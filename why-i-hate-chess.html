				<h1>Why I Hate Chess</h1>
				<h2>And Lessons I Learned From It</h2>
				<div class="chunk">
				<p>I’m a believer in the idea that <a
				href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/">95-ile isn’t that good</a>. I
				remember reading this post for the first time years ago and agreeing
				with the author’s point that although the idea initially sounds elitist,
				in fact it’s quite encouraging, because it suggests that most people can
				actually achieve much more than they initially think if they follow
				certain principles. Additionally, I just think it’s fulfilling to try to
				do a good job at whatever I put my time towards doing.</p>
				<p>Throughout my life, one of my big hobbies was playing chess. I’ve
				gone through three main periods when I really got into the game: once in
				high school, once in college, and once during the pandemic. As someone
				naturally inclined to playing strategy games and with a competitive
				streak, chess is an activity that is about as objective as it gets when
				it comes to ranking its players based on skill. It uses a commonly
				understood <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo
				rating scale</a> and I think most people have been exposed to it one way
				or another, particularly in recent years after its explosion in
				popularity after the Queen’s Gambit show. However, despite it often
				being portrayed in the media as a game requiring intelligence to master,
				I think that (like almost all things) anyone can get quite good at it if
				they really want to.</p>
				<p>The first thing to know is that chess can be played with many
				different time controls ranging from truly degenerate online variants
				like ultrabullet (15-seconds per player) to the more formally played
				in-person / over-the-board classical (3+ hours) time controls. My
				favorite time control in chess has always been bullet chess (or 1|0,
				i.e. one minute per player, zero increment per move). My reasoning is
				that it’s an ideal time control where you can still play a full-fledged
				game of logical moves without it being so accelerated that the person
				with the fastest mouse speed wins but also without it being so slow that
				you have to dedicate a large chunk of time to playing a single game.
				This also means that iteration cycles can be shortened, which is
				important because this allows one to become exposed to many different
				scenarios in a short amount of time. I think this is an important
				feature in many areas of life, because the faster you make mistakes, the
				faster you can improve.</p>
				<p>For as long as I can remember, my opening strategy in chess has been
				heavily tailored towards speed chess. Whereas many “classically trained”
				chess players possess a repertoire of many openings for each side (white
				and black), I have always played not only the same opening for each
				color but in fact the same opening for both colors (simply mirroring my
				white opening for black). My logic was that in limited time controls, it
				makes sense to focus my efforts on learning a single opening and
				learning it well instead of learning many different openings. Bullet
				chess heavily relies on pattern recognition and playing the same opening
				allowed me to experience playing against almost every possible type of
				response in the first x moves – meanwhile my opponents have rarely
				encountered opponents who play my opening. This often forces opponents
				to waste valuable time thinking about how to respond as I’m able to
				blitz out my familiar moves. This teaches the lesson that when
				everyone is zigging (with mainline theory), you can go a long way just
				by zagging (and playing offbeat sidelines). Even though my
				chess opening may be theoretically unsound (i.e. not perfect), it was
				still able to get me a long way. This can be seen in many areas beyond
				chess as well. One example that comes to mind is players who have
				questionable shooting form like Lonzo Ball who are still able to make it
				to the NBA. You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to be good
				enough. Many times, <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">perfect
				is the enemy of good</a>.</p>
				<p>However, just because you have a fast iteration cycle, play a lot of
				games, and do something unorthodox doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll end
				up good at chess. You still have to learn from your mistakes and
				understand why you’re failing. This often means taking a step back and
				seeing the bigger picture. It’s easy to think that chess is just a
				matter of seeing your opponent make a move in front of you and having to
				figure out the best move to make in response. But in a game with such an
				expansive decision tree as chess, memorizing responses to different
				moves and positions does not scale well at all. No matter how many games
				you play, you’ll never encounter every chess position, which <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">outnumbers the
				number of atoms in the universe</a>. Instead, a far more efficient way
				to improve is to learn from repeated mistakes and internalize principles
				that can translate and apply to positions you’ve never seen before.
				Learning concepts like putting rooks on open files / ranks, trying to
				preserve the bishop pair, and understanding how to deal with open /
				closed boards are heuristics that will actually make you a better chess
				player and allow you to plan ahead instead of simply being someone who
				knows how to respond to specific moves. An important lesson to be
				learned here is to learn principles instead of memorizing
				things. “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a
				man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.”</p>
				<p>Last year in 2024, I checked out the premiere of the film <a
				href="https://tribecafilm.com/films/thinking-game-2024">The Thinking
				Game</a> at the 2024 Tribeca Film Festival. The movie is a biopic that
				chronicles the life of Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of Google DeepMind
				(and a chess prodigy in his youth). I remember watching the scene of a
				young Demis going to an international chess tournament in which he
				entered a grueling <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame">endgame</a> against
				an elderly Soviet master. It came down to a position where he just had
				to make a single move to secure a draw, but after playing for hours on
				end, he was so exhausted and had expended all his mental energy, that he
				made one final blunder that lost him the game. However, what was
				interesting was that although the loss was devastating, even worse was
				how so much brainpower was exhausted in a playing hall with hundreds of
				minds focused on playing a simple game. The rest of the movie documented
				how Hassabis put chess on the backburner and started pursuing other
				areas of his life like working at a video game company before eventually
				starting Google Deepmind, one of the companies spearheading the modern
				AI revolution. Many would consider this to be a much greater
				accomplishment than being good at pushing pieces on a wooden board or
				computer screen all day. It’s important to climb the right mountain and
				pick the right battles.</p>
				<p>All in all, I think my experiences with chess have taught me some
				valuable lessons, as well as improved my deductive skills, mental
				endurance, and overall cognitive abilities. However, I generally think
				now that staring at a computer screen for hours on end battling kids
				from halfway around the world is not really a productive use of time at
				all (related to why I don’t care too much for video games). I consider
				myself more or less retired from chess and mostly try to stay away from
				it now (although I can still be coerced into playing a few games of 1|0
				when I’m truly bored, or follow some professional events). Instead, I
				basically replaced playing chess with more active hobbies like running,
				which can help train both the body and mind at once (<a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asics">ASICS -- “anima sana in
				corpore sano” / “a sound mind, in a sound body”</a>). Anyways, thanks for
				reading!</p>
