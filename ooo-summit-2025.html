				<h1>Why I Invested in Carry + <br>Attending the OOO Summit</h1>

				<div class="chunk">
				<p>I first heard about <a href="https://x.com/ankurnagpal">Ankur Nagpal</a> several years ago when scrolling
				through X (still Twitter at the time) and reading his interesting tweet
				threads. As someone interested in personal finance, I found Ankur‚Äôs
				posts on topics such as <a
				href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ankurnagpal_the-most-remarkable-tax-loophole-activity-7340492188738351104-3tG-/">Mega Backdoor Roths</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ankurnagpal_the-biggest-financial-mistake-a-founder-can-activity-7254147943190933506-siBt/">QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock)</a> to be both useful and enlightening. Over time, I started attending some
				of the free virtual seminars that he periodically hosted where I started
				learning more about the company that he founded named <a
				href="https://carry.com/">Carry</a>. Carry is a company
				with a mission to be an "all-in-one platform for tax-advantaged
				accounts, investments and strategy for business owners and high earning
				professionals."</p>

				<p>So when the opportunity came last summer and Ankur announced on X
				that he was raising a $10M Series A for Carry, including $1M from <a
				href="https://x.com/ankurnagpal/status/1814309901331570864">customers and the community</a>,
				I knew I wanted to participate. Ankur‚Äôs credentials as a second-time
				founder (he previously started and <a
				href="https://x.com/ankurnagpal/status/1914686120652132501">sold Teachable</a>),
				a <a href="https://fjlin.me/studies">fellow Berkeley alum</a> (go Bears! üîµüêªüü°), and the overall hustle that
				he exhibits (as demonstrated by his willingness to perform cold outreach
				and share his wisdom with the world) all make me strongly believe in him as a
				founder. At first, my e-mail expressing interest in the round was met
				with no reply, but after a second e-mail, I got a response and was able
				to participate through <a href="https://www.angellist.com/">AngelList</a>. AngelList is one platform that allows
				individuals to invest in private market companies, alongside EquityZen
				and other platforms. One common misconception is that you need to be
				wealthy to invest in startups, but you can read my friend Nate‚Äôs article
				on why this is not the case and on how to become an accredited investor <a
				href="https://www.natecation.com/accredited-investor-investing-startups-series-65/">here</a>.
				It is important to note that compared to investing in public companies, investing in
				private companies typically involves a longer investment horizon and is
				higher risk, but at the same time can provide an opportunity to
				diversify one‚Äôs portfolio and achieve <a
				href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/09/uncorrelated-assets-diversification.asp">uncorrelated returns</a>. I believe that Carry fills a unique niche in providing value and
				assisting small business owners in achieving their financial goals,
				while also <a
				href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaiyagill_community-is-still-the-most-underrated-growth-activity-7336051915555774468-c1wW/">building a community</a> around it (shoutout to <a href="https://beacons.ai/jaiya">Jaiya Gill</a>!). Note that this post does not contain any financial, investment, legal,
				or tax advice.</p>

				<p>My interests in entrepreneurship originated in high school, when I
				did a research project in my senior year and wrote a paper on the topic of "What
				makes a leader of a tech company great?" I read books like <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">Zero to One</a> by Peter Thiel
				and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_to_Great">Good to Great</a> by Jim Collins,
				as well as profiles on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Click">Jeff Bezos</a> by Richard Brandt
				and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)">Steve Jobs</a> by Walter Isaacson.
				Learning about Silicon Valley and the stories of these individuals was
				one of the reasons I chose to attend UC Berkeley in the Bay Area to get
				closer to the world of tech. Although I do not currently work at a
				startup, I find it personally interesting to stay attuned with the
				larger startup landscape, as these startups are the source of many
				innovations in our modern world (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). I also
				enjoy observing and talking with my friends / peers who are starting or working at
				startups, applying to YCombinator with ideas, working on their own side
				projects and more. In addition to entrepreneurship, the world of startup
				investment has also fascinated me and last year, I became close friends
				with a venture capitalist from whom I learned a lot about the process by
				which firms invest in companies. Finally, over the years, I‚Äôve also
				listened to many episodes of podcasts like the <a
				href="https://allin.com/">All-In Podcast</a>, <a
				href="https://www.acquired.fm/">Acquired</a>, and <a
				href="https://www.mfmpod.com/">My First Million</a>, which
				explore the worlds of investing and entrepreneurship.</p>

				<img src="./photos/ooo-summit-2025/mixer-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>OOO Summit Mixer</i></p>

				<p>These are all reasons why this year, I was determined to attend the
				<a href="https://go.carry.com/ooo">OOO Summit</a> hosted by
				Carry and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrew.today">Andrew Yeung</a> (OOO stands for Owners, Operators, and Outliers),
				especially after having missed the event last year. I went straight from
				JFK after returning from Copenhagen (where I had just <a href="https://fjlin.me/running">run the Copenhagen
				Marathon</a> to qualify for next year's Boston Marathon)
				to the first mixer event at the Arlo Williamsburg (the view from the rooftop
				was amazing!). One of my goals in attending this event was to meet Ankur
				in person for the first time, which I was particularly excited about
				since he is someone whose high agency has personally inspired me
				(previously, our only connections were my friend who works at Carry and
				me virtually giving him Strava kudos). I was also excited by the
				opportunity to meet fellow members of the community who shared similar
				passions as me in entrepreneurship. At the mixers over the next few
				days, I met and had interesting conversations with people such as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_varunrana">Varun</a> who left his big tech job to pursue content creation full time, <a
				href="https://www.instagram.com/thecuriousmaverick">Soundarya</a> who helps high-skilled immigrants get
				talent visas, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kvstabla">Sid</a> who is a professional musician and content creator, Renee who runs her own business in Ohio renting out construction tools, and Edward who started his own podcast and attends the <a href="http://nyrr.org/getinvolved/club/pitchandrun">PitchAndRun run club</a>, among others. On the final day of the summit, there was a great lineup
				of speakers that included an interview between Ankur and Andrew Yang
				(the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang">former presidential candidate</a>) as well as Sahil Bloom (author of  <a
				href="https://www.the5typesofwealth.com/">The 5 Types of Wealth</a>
				as well as a <a href="https://x.com/SahilBloom/status/1755213197596897359">speedy marathon runner</a> himself).
				Although it was a hectic week of events, I found the OOO Summit to be
				very well organized and an overall positive experience that I would
				recommend to others for next year!</p>

				<img src="./photos/ooo-summit-2025/summit-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>OOO Summit Final Day</i></p>

				<p>A few weeks later, I followed up the summit by attending another event with a friend
				during <a href="https://www.tech-week.com/">NY Tech Week</a> called
				the <a href="https://lu.ma/extravaganza">AI Extravaganza</a>, which
				was also hosted by Andrew Yeung (the other cohost of the OOO Summit).
				There I met more interesting people, including Jinny who is working on a
				<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/beyondbrain/">platform</a>
				that "plugs into any hotel tech stack to personalise guest journeys,
				unlock new upsell revenue, and automate daily ops". It was my first
				time attending an event like this in NYC and I went in expecting to meet
				‚Äúnetworky‚Äù people, but I was pleasantly surprised and found it to be a
				fun way to meet people who shared similar interests as me. Going
				forward, I would be open to attending more similar events in the future as
				a result!</p>

				<p>All in all, I had a great experience at the OOO Summit and I will
				continue to root for the success of Carry. Have you ever invested in or
				worked on a startup idea or side project that you found interesting?
				Feel free to reach out and let me know, as I would love to hear your
				thoughts! As always, thank you for reading and until next time!</p>
