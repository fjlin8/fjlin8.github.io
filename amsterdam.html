		<h1>Amsterdam üá≥üá±</h1>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/wCzqfJO.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">After taking an overnight train, I arrived in the morning at Amsterdam Centraal train station, the red building in the right of this picture. Amsterdam is the capital and most populous city in the Netherlands, as well as the country‚Äôs cultural center. The city is particularly unique for its comprehensive canal system, the result of successful and extensive city planning.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/jIQrL0K.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Amsterdam‚Äôs canal system consists of three major canals: the Herengracht, the Prisengracht, and the Keizersgracht. Together, they form concentric rings that encircle the city and allow for movement by boat.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/wtSijRM.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Koninklijk Paleis, or Royal Palace, is a major tourist attraction found at Dam, one of Amsterdam‚Äôs town squares. It was originally built as a city hall but was converted to a royal palace under the reign of King Lodewijk Napoleon, otherwise known as Louis Napol√©on Bonaparte.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/3U9q1ih.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">One of my favorite museums that I visited on my trip was the Van Gogh Museum, found at the Museumplein (Museum Square). The museum holds a collection of many of Van Gogh‚Äôs works, but perhaps more interestingly many of the letters he wrote in his correspondences. He communicated greatly with his family and other artists, and in particular with his brother, Theo. These letters have become an important source for understanding Van Gogh‚Äôs personal life.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/kft60vD.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Also located at Dam is the Nationaal Monument, or National Monument, which was designed as a World War II memorial. It‚Äôs a popular place for people to relax and you can find lots of tourists (and even more pigeons) at the foot of the monument. The square, Dam, is named as such because it was originally a dam on the Amstel River, for which the city is named after.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/wJBer8t.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Bloemenmarkt, found on the Singel canal, is the world‚Äôs only floating flower market. It consists of various flower stalls located on a row of barges, each of which sells the tulips that Holland is known for.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/LZhjrmW.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Rijksmuseum, seen in the background, is the Dutch national museum which is also located at Museumplein. After recently undergoing a ten-year renovation from 2003 to 2013, it is today the largest museum in the Netherlands. In front of the Rijksmuseum, you can see the popular ‚ÄúI amsterdam‚Äù letters that make for a popular photograph location.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/xZx5PbB.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">One thing that‚Äôs cool about Amsterdam is that as you navigate the city, you‚Äôll see a lot of the city flag. The design of three white crosses on a black stripe sandwiched by two red stripes is ubiquitous around the city. It flies over many city buildings, including the InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam hotel seen in this picture, alongside the Dutch national flag.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/zkt2AVu.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Netherlands are also known for their many molens, or windmills. Although I wasn‚Äôt able to make a trip to the Dutch countryside, I did visit the De Gooyer windmill in East Amsterdam. De Gooyer is the tallest wooden windmill in the Netherlands and now has a brewery below it.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/xgK9fcb.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Another really cool museum that I visited was the Anne Frank Huis, or Anne Frank House, located in the same building where Frank hid during World War II. Although the line to enter was long, the walkthrough was informative and thought-provoking. Walking around Amsterdam, it was difficult to imagine what the city must‚Äôve been like under Nazi occupation.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/3QEZrdI.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">A trip to Amsterdam is not complete without a visit to De Wallen, the city‚Äôs most prominent red light district. At night, the atmosphere in the area is bustling and one can find plenty of prostitutes behind windows illuminated by red light. Right at the center of the red light district, you can find the old church, or Oude Kerk, which is actually the city‚Äôs oldest building (from the 1300s). </p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hvv9hlw.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">On my last day in Amsterdam, I decided to take the ferry north of the train station to Amsterdam-Noord, the northern borough of Amsterdam. It was a fun experience, since you can definitely feel a different vibe in this newer part of the city. At first, I was wandering aimlessly and ended up in some district with a bunch of car repair shops, but eventually I found a really cool street market called Pekmarkt.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/xNbViDv.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Visiting a Dutch market like Pekmarkt was an interesting look into the lives of the locals. It was also an opportunity for me to try some Dutch food, so I tried a haring (raw herring) sandwich with pickles/onions. kibbeling (battered chunks of deep fried fish), and poffertjes (small Dutch pancakes).</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/H4kDFTz.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The city‚Äôs main train station itself, Amsterdam Centraal, is its own tourist attraction, showing off a mix of Neo-Gothic and Neo-Renaissance styles. In front of the station, you can also find a massive bike park, which makes sense since Amsterdam is completely filled with bikes everywhere you go. In fact, the city has more bikes than it has people!</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/MXtiQtJ.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Finally, the streets in downtown Amsterdam are filled with people and lined with stores. A lot of the streets in Amsterdam are really old and narrow, clearly not designed for modern cars. As a result, you won‚Äôt find many automobiles in the city center; instead you‚Äôll find lots of pedestrians, and lots more bikes. </p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/aHDY3Wv.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">All in all, I really enjoyed my time in Amsterdam and all its awesome canals. From what I could tell, Amsterdam certainly felt like the most liberal city in the world and the city‚Äôs museums were also fun to visit. My stay in Amsterdam ended just where it began ‚Äì the Centraal Station ‚Äì as I boarded the train towards my next destination, Brussels!</p>
