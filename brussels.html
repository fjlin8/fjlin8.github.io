		<h1>Brussels ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª</h1>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/9Sr31Id.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Welcome to Grote Markt, or Grand Place, the magnificent central square of Brussels. To talk about Brussels a bit, it is the capital and largest city of Belgium. One of the notable things about Belgium is that the country is actually relatively divided between its Dutch- and French-speaking communities, formed primarily by the Flemings and Walloons. Brussels is a mix of both communities, as itâ€™s geographically surrounded by Flanders, but has French as its majority language. As a result, while traversing the city, you will often see signs in both French and Dutch (and sometimes English).</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/0YCKuH8.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Grote Markt itself has a history of almost an entire millennium. Originally, it developed as an open-air market, and over the course of the next few centuries its buildings were rebuilt multiple times. The buildings here today were built starting in the fifteenth century. The previous picture and this picture both show some of the guildhalls standing at Grote Markt.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/BvueTrb.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">However, the most impressive building at Grote Markt is HÃ´tel de Ville or Stadhuis, the Brussels Town Hall. Constructed in the early fifteenth century, it was bombed by the French in 1695 but later rebuilt. At all times of the day, Grote Markt is bustling with people and itâ€™s truly an incredible place to be.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/A8eXnQc.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">This is the Bourse or Beurs, the building that houses the old Brussels Stock Exchange, located on Boulevard Anspach. The square itâ€™s located in is called the Place de la Bourse or Beursplein and a cool place to sit down and people-watch while listening to street musicians. On the Beurs building itself, you can find many graffiti messages pleading for peace.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/wBblw28.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Another popular tourist attraction in Brussels is Manneken-Pis or Petit Julien, a small bronze statue of a pissing boy. Occasionally, the statue is dressed up for special events, and there is usually a large crowd of tourists trying to take a picture in front of it.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/pciiIv6.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The statue of King Albert I in front of Kunstberg or Mont des Arts (mount of the arts). Unlike most of the other cities I visited, Brussels is actually quite hilly and so you can see some other parts of the city from the elevated Mont des Arts.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/p5shgYn.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Parc de Bruxelles or Warandepark (Brussels Park) is a park located in the eastern side of Brussels. It was a really peaceful place with joggers and people relaxing in the grass. At the center of the park is a large fountain and around the park, you can find many important buildings.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/eJ5j6RD.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">One of these buildings is the Palais de la Nation. It houses the Parlement FÃ©dÃ©ral Belge or FÃ¶derales Parlament (Belgian Federal Parliament). Waving in front of the palace are both the Belgian and EU flags. The two bodies that meet in this building are the Kamer van Volksvertegenwoordigers or Chambre des ReprÃ©sentants (Chamber of Representatives) and the Senaat/SÃ©nat/Senate.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/3MhR9WB.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Directly opposite of the Palais de la Nation and Parc de Bruxelles is the Koninklijk Paleis van Brussel or Palais Royal de Bruxelles (Royal Palace of Brussels). It is the official palace of the Belgium monarchy and is located in the same place as the original Coudenberg Palace from the 12th century.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Zlg41ra.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Monument Ã  La Gloire de l'infanterie Belge or Infantry Memorial of Brussels is a monument dedicated to the Belgian soldiers of World Wars I and II. It is located at the Place Poelaert or Poelaertplein, adjacent to the Palais de Justice de Bruxelles.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/dwBEDxw.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">From Place Poelaert, you can get a nice elevated view of the city and itâ€™s a nice place to just sit down and relax for a bit. When going to different cities, I like to go out of the way of normal touristy locations to just sit down and take it all in.</p>

		<p class="captions">This is the Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels, known for being the jihad capital of Europe. Molenbeek has been a poster child for urban decline in recent years, making its juxtaposition with the result of Brussels particularly striking. As a result, Molenbeek has been especially vulnerable to terrorism in recent years, and it was heavily connected with the Paris attacks of November 2015.</p>

		<p class="captions">The Atomium was originally constructed for the 1958 Worldâ€™s Fair in Brussels. The architectural spectacle represents an elementary iron crystal magnified several billion times and its spheres are open to the public. As you go through the spheres, there are exhibitions on the history of the structure and from the top, you can get a nice view from 102 meters up.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/SNmPA7P.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Apart from being the capital of Belgium, Brussels is also one of the capitals of the European Union. This is the Paul-Henri Spaak building of the Espace LÃ©opold or Leopoldruimte complex, which houses the European Parliament. It is located in the European quarter in east Brussels, along with various other governmental buildings.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/XNMtbEy.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Also located in the parliamentary quarter is the Berlaymont building, which is home to the headquarters of the European Commission. The European Commission is the EUâ€™s executive body and is based off the ideas of Robert Schuman. The building itself is notable for its unique cross shape.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/MJRkAUP.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Walking even further east, you can find the Arcade du Cinquantenaire, yet another monumental triumphal arch in the Parc du Cinquantenaire. The park was built during the reign of King LÃ©opold II while the arc was built in 1880 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence.</p>

		<p class="captions">My stay in Brussels ended at the Bruxelles Central station. I would say that Brussels is a rather administrative city, quite similar to Washington D.C. And although it was a little odd at times to walk amidst militarized soldiers in the streets, the city itself was fun to explore; overall, it was a fun city to visit!</p>
