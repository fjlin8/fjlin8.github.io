				<h1>Fastpacking Alta Via 1</h1>
				<div class="chunk">
				<p>This July, I went to Italy and did the Alta Via 1 trail in the
				Dolomites in the Italian Alps. For those not familiar, the Alta Vias
				(literally: "high roads") are a series of long distance routes in Italy
				that go through mountainous terrain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_Via_1">Alta Via 1</a> is the most famous of these
				routes and begins at a lake called Lago di Braies and ends at a road in
				La Pissa, near Belluno. The area can be accessed via a 1-2 hour drive
				from Venice. The trail spans a total of approximately 75 mi (120 km) in
				distance and 25,000 ft (7,500 m) in elevation gain, almost the height of
				Mt. Everest! Those hiking often complete it in 9-10 days while those
				trail running can finish it in as few as 4-5 days, depending on fitness
				levels and interest in spending more or less time at the various huts
				(referred to in Italy as rifugios). My friend Angela and I decided to
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastpacking">fastpack</a> (combination of
				trail running + backpacking) it in a total of 5 days, which meant we
				needed to cover an average of around 15 mi (24 km) and 5,000 ft (1,500 m) per day.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/alta-vias.jpg" width="580px" height="386px"><br><i>Alta Via Routes 1-6 in the Dolomites</i></p>

				<h2 align=center><b>Pre-Trip Planning</b></h2>

				<p>We committed to doing the hike quite late (around the end of June)
				compared to most people. Due to the increasing popularity of routes like
				Alta Via 1 and also the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_du_Mont_Blanc">Tour de Mont Blanc (TMB)</a>, the huts are often
				booked out far in advance, with people often planning their summer trips
				over half a year out or even in the fall of the year before.
				We heard some of the most popular huts are already sold out for the
				summer by January. Many people also book through agencies for more cost
				at the tradeoff of peace of mind, but we chose to book the huts
				ourselves (which can be done through websites or via e-mail). Luckily,
				since it was just the two of us and with a lot of refreshing of tabs, we
				were able to book two beds for the four nights of huts by July 8, just
				over three weeks before the start of our hike. In the event that no huts
				are available, some backup options to still do the hike are to take
				buses at the end of each day to nearby accommodations, to camp
				(supposedly legal in Italy after sunset and before sunrise), or just to
				to do day hikes instead of the whole Alta Via.</p>

				<h2 align=center><b>Pre-Trip Packing</b></h2>

				<p>Since this was my first time doing a multi-day hike, I had to borrow
				and buy some things in NYC before my trip. For the
				backpack, my experienced backpacker friend Jared (who has previously
				done Alta Via 2) generously lent me his <a href="https://ultimatedirection.com/fastpack-20">Fastpack 20L</a> bag. I then went with my other
				experienced outdoorsman friend Talal to the REI in SoHo (which
				supposedly has a full-year return policy if you sign up to be a member)
				to buy a <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/247273/katadyn-befree-ac-10-l-water-filter-bottle">Katadyn 1L water filter</a>, a <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/202774/black-diamond-spot-400-headlamp">Black Diamond headlamp</a>, and a
				<a href="https://www.rei.com/product/850235/cocoon-microfiber-mummy-liner">Cocoon sleeping bag liner</a>.</p>

				<p>Then we went to the Nike store in Soho and I bought
				a pair of <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/pegasus-trail-5-mens-trail-running-shoes-0ZrZ4D">Nike Pegasus Trail 5</a> trail running shoes, which I felt made sense for
				me since my road running daily trainers are the Nike Pegasus. Some
				differences between the trail Pegs and the regular Pegs are that the
				trail versions have a thicker outsole and more durable upper to
				withstand tough conditions. However, you can also wear the trail runners
				as a regular road running shoe as well, which I also did with no issue.
				I was recommended by multiple people not to get the GoreTex version of
				the trail runners since those are intended to be waterproof, which also
				means water cannot go out.</p>

				<p>Apart from these purchases, for clothes I packed some tank tops, shirts, shorts,
				underwear, pants, socks, a quarter-zip, and a jacket. Given the variable
				weather in the mountains, layers are important since there are some
				days where the weather can be in the high 70s Fahrenheit (low 20s
				Celsius) and other days where the weather can be in the low 40s (low
				single digits Celsius) – on our hike, we even got a hail warning on one day. There are
				also often afternoon thunderstorms in the mountains, so a good
				waterproof layer is important (as I was to discover). As always,
				sunscreen is important when spending a lot of time outdoors.</p>

				<p>For
				electronics, I brought my iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, my Anker battery
				pack, a universal converter, and a variety of charging cables for my
				phone, battery pack, watch, etc. Angela also brought a satellite phone
				in the event of an emergency as most of the areas on the hike do not
				have service. For the huts, I brought a small towel for showering and
				hut sandals for walking around (although some huts had both of these to
				borrow). I did not bring hiking poles since I never used them before and
				didn’t want to try something new for a multi-day hike, but in retrospect
				I could see how they could be useful.</p>

				<h2 align=center><b>Pre-Trip Preparation</b></h2>

				<p>In terms of fitness, I felt quite prepared for the hike as I’ve been
				road running for a few years now in New York and have kept up a steady
				dosage of weekly mileage for the past couple years (around 50 miles per
				week these days). Having run two 107mi weeks training for the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/14444770770">Copenhagen
				Marathon</a> in the spring, the distance seemed manageable (especially
				given we had the whole day from breakfast to dinnertime to get between the
				huts). The main thing that intimidated me was the elevation gain, since
				I had never done this much elevation in such a short span of time (I was
				hoping that all the Harlem Hills would have prepared me well) so I was unclear how my body would respond. As
				mentioned earlier, it was my first time doing a multi-day hike as well
				as my first time doing trail running, but luckily Angela is very
				experienced in both these areas so I was fortunate to be doing it
				with her rather than solo. The morning of the day I flew out to Italy, I ran the <a href="https://results.nyrr.org/event/25CHAMPS5M/result/722">NYRR 5M Team Champs</a> race where I was happy with my time, so I felt like I was in good fitness.</p>

				<h2 align=center><b><img src="./flags/italy.png"> A Few Days in Rome <img src="./flags/italy.png"></b></h2>

				<p>I flew out a few days before the hike on international business class
				for the first time (snagged a solid 55k Alaska Airlines mileage redemption on American Airlines metal from JFK to FCO thanks to Justin!).  I then spent a few days in Rome where I met up with my
				friend Celine. In Rome, I did some fun runs, including two runs by the
				River Tiber (<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15266522918">running north</a> + <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15279147045">running south</a>), a fun <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15272297192">interval workout</a>
				at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico">Foro Italico</a> which was built by Mussolini
				to try to get the 1940 Olympic Games to Rome, and a <a
				href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15289460861">run in the Villa
				Borghese</a>, a landscape garden built by the cardinal Scipione Borghese. I also did a cool <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15289276926">bike ride on the Via Appia Antica</a>, a cobblestone road and UNESCO world heritage site with 2,300 years of history. Finally, I had a lot of good pasta, pizza, bruschetta, porchetta, and gelato in Rome! </p>

				<h2 align=center><b><img src="./flags/italy.png"> Travel to Cortina <img src="./flags/italy.png"></b></h2>

				<p>The day before the hike, I took the Frecciarossa train from Rome up
				to Venice Mestre (on the mainland). During my layover in Venice, I
				rented a city bike and did a quick <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15298291752">bike ride to downtown Venice</a> across
				the Ponte della Libertà and then <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15298318408">ran back the same way</a>
				 to the train station, where I bought some snacks at a Chinese
				supermarket for the trail (I was surprised to find a Chinese supermarket
				here, but I suppose Venice is where Marco Polo departed to China from
				after all). I bought some fruit snacks, sour straps, chocolates, and <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachima">sachima</a>
				before then taking the Cortina Express bus (where I met up with Angela) to
				Cortina d’Ampezzo, where we stayed the night before the first day of the
				hike.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/ponte-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/ponte-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Cool trainspotting on the Ponte della Libertà</i></p>

				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortina_d%27Ampezzo">Cortina</a> is a famous mountain town which will be host to the 2026
				Winter Olympics next year. We walked around the quaint little downtown
				and saw a bunch of shops, but didn’t have too much time to explore due
				to time constraints. It would be cool to visit again in the wintertime
				for skiing. The hotel we stayed at was able to accommodate luggage
				storage for a reasonable cost (3€ per bag per night) until we returned
				to Cortina after the end of the hike. We had a yummy dinner at the hotel
				before packing our bags the night before resting up for our first day of
				hiking!</p>

				<p>For the next part of this post, I journaled my reflections at the end
				of each day of the hike on Strava, so I’ll simply copy those daily logs
				over here. They are a bit lengthy but I think they helped capture the
				essence of whatever was top of mind for me on each day! Feel free to
				read or skip at your leisure. Below the day 5 log, you can read my
				reflections on the trip overall.</p>

				<h2 align=center><b><img src="./flags/italy.png"> Alta Via 1 - Day 1 (0–18km) <img src="./flags/italy.png"></b>
				<p><strong><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15311164758">Strava Activity</a></strong></p></h2>

				<p>I’m back in the mountains! First time fastpacking / trail running and
				the most elevation (5k+ feet) that I’ve ascended in a day. Italian Alps
				views were beautiful and had a great time!</p>

				<p>We got up at 7am and ate breakfast at the hotel before making the 20
				minute walk to the bus stop. We then took the 445 bus to Dobbiaco and
				transferred to the 442 bus to Lago di Briaes (reservation needed). The
				first stretch by the lake was crowded with tourists (as expected) until
				we made a left to begin our ascent.</p>

				<p>The ascent was challenging and my first big uphill climb in a while
				(I haven’t done too many of these types of climbs other than Faulhorn in
				Switzerland and Mt Panorama in Kazakhstan). We steadily made progress
				and made it to the top in due time (mostly hiking to this point),
				stopping for lunch at 12:30pm at Rifugio Biella (the pasta
				all’Amatriciana was great)!</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/lago-di-briaes-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/lago-di-briaes-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Lago di Brieas and first day of climbing</i></p>

				<p>We got there right in time, as the afternoon thunderstorms started
				right after we entered the hut, dumping rain and making it difficult to
				proceed. We decided to try waiting out the rain for as long as we could
				until we decided at 2pm that we had to go so that we could make it in
				time to our hut for dinner.</p>
				<p>At this point, we started trail running a bit (my first time ever)
				which was harder than expected with the backpack. Nevertheless, it was
				quite a fun experience, and it helped make the rainy miles go by faster.
				Soon later, the weather cleared up again and we made another stop at the
				rifugio in Sennes.</p>
				<p>After that, we had a long descent to Pederü, where we stopped and
				layed down for a bit and admired the view (so pretty!). Finally, we made
				our final climb (heart rate finally went above 150) up to Fanes, where
				we chatted with a cool Dutch couple who was also doing a multi-day hike
				for the first time. We said goodbye to them as they parted ways at
				Fanes.</p>
				<p>We finally got to our hut in Lavarella at 5:30pm, just in time to
				take a shower and catch dinner at 6pm! All in all, it was a great day,
				and looking forward to what’s next! 😊</p>

				<p><strong><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15320362979">Strava Activity</a></strong></p></h2>

				<p>Treacherous day of hiking / running in the pouring rain for almost
				all of it, everything got completely soaked. Lots of type 2 fun and made
				completing it all the more fulfilling!</p>
				<p>We woke up at 6:15am and ate breakfast at 7am at Lavarella hut (the
				homemade honey was amazing!). We headed out right after breakfast to try
				to make as much progress as we could before the afternoon storm that was
				projected to hit. Upbeat mood for the first hour or so, as we made some
				trail friends!</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-2-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-2-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Good start to the day!</i></p>

				<p>We ran into the same Russian hiker from Munich that we saw at lunch
				yesterday, who told us he was here on a weekend trip (four hour drive)
				and who was actually camping (the tent in his pack sure looked heavy).
				We also chatted in Mandarin with a nice Chinese-Canadian couple from
				Markham who told us they had done UMTB previously and were here for a
				few weeks, including doing hut to hut in 10 days. Cool to see some
				fellow Chinese hikers out on the trail (the demographic here is mostly
				Europeans / Americans)!</p>

				<p>We then started an ascent where we met a couple of Australians from
				Brisbane who were also fastpacking AV1 hut to hut in 5 days. I had
				responded to the guy’s echolocation shout of “cooee” with the same, not
				realizing it was an iconic Aussie phrase, since he later approached me
				by asking which part of Australia I was from, to which I responded New
				York. The guy said the two of them had started road running earlier in
				the pandemic for a year or two before transitioning into trail running
				the last three years, but might go back for a road PR at the Gold Coast
				Marathon (I’ve heard this one is fast). He also said I look like I’m a
				fast runner, which I took as a compliment. 😅</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/lagazuoi-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/lagazuoi-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Crazy descent to Lagazuòi</i></p>

				<p>We continued running with the Australians for a bit down a crazy
				descent into Lagazuoi with a ton of switchbacks. The rain was still
				manageable at this point, and the view of the lake emerging from the
				clouds was just amazing. After the lake, we entered another ascent
				alongside the Aussies until we finally parted ways near Rifugio
				Lagazuòi.</p>

				<p>In the interest of time / avoiding the storm, we decided not to make
				the diversion to Rifugio Lagazuòi (our hut for the night was also
				further than theirs), which would have been another mile / 500ft of
				elevation each way. We tried continuing to Falzarego, but while we were
				chatting, we somehow got off our intended route. After analyzing for a
				bit, we decided to renavigate to a new route, including going slightly
				off the main trail. Adaptibility is important in the mountains. We
				continued on as the rain was really dumping on us now, when we
				serendipitously found a cave which we decided to take refuge in at
				11:20am.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/cave-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/cave-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Hiding from the rain in a cave</i></p>

				<p>After a short snack break in the cave, we proceeded onwards into the
				pouring rain and ran down another series of switchbacks and saw Cinque
				Torri for the first time (which Angela mentioned is a popular climbing
				spot, at least in better conditions). We ran through a cool tunnel and
				took cover under the awning of a house where we tried to plot our plan
				for the final stretch (as we again went off our intended route). We
				encountered a lot of issues using our phones in the pouring rain (with
				nothing dry to wipe the screens off with) and the original saved route
				on Angela’s watch was sadly of no use after we deviated. Putting phones
				in a Ziploc bag could be a good move for the future (but then maybe not
				as many pictures 🤔 Unless I buy a camera 👀).</p>

				<p>Nevertheless, spirits were still quite high despite the adversity (I
				love challenges!). We made yet another very muddy climb and even muddier
				descent (shoes have never looked so brown) -- it was quite fun
				problem-solving the descent since I haven’t done too many downhill runs
				through the mud and I think I did quite well. 😀 There really is
				something special about hiking / trail running that you can’t get when
				you’re in New York.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/muddy-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/muddy-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>A very muddy descent</i></p>

				<p>As we made it past the road, we made one final ascent up to Croda di
				Lago on trail 434 / 437, at which point the rain finally started
				clearing up a bit. There was a viewpoint with a great view overlooking
				Cortina and after one last climbing push, we saw the lake and made it to
				Rifugio Croda da Lago at around 3pm.</p>

				<p>It took a while to peel off all my wet clothes / socks / shoes and
				sadly I discovered I did not do a good job waterproofing the rest of the
				stuff in my backpack, so I am now typing this trip report up under the
				warm, dry covers of my bed. Another 18mi in the book and 6k feet of
				elevation gain. Can’t wait for dinner! 😀</p>

				<h2 align=center><b><img src="./flags/italy.png"> Alta Via 1 - Day 3 (43–60km) <img src="./flags/italy.png"></b>
				<p><strong><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15335022421">Strava Activity</a></strong></p></h2>

				<p>Another fun day on the trails, including the first 8mi with our new
				friend Ben, then a big climb up to Coldai, where we were rewarded with
				an incredible view. Lots of good convos! 😀</p>

				<p>I woke up at 7:15am and ate breakfast at the hut with Ben who we met
				last night at dinner. He happens to be from central Jersey and also
				lives in NYC, which I guess I shouldn’t even be surprised by. Young
				techies are everywhere these days.</p>

				<p>Today was a lazier morning and after breakfast, I took a walk around
				Lago Fedèra and took some pictures while Angela waited for her clothes
				to dry. We also did a mini photoshoot. 📸 After yesterday’s longer,
				rainy day, we decided today should be more chill with the lesser mileage
				and better weather. We finally headed out from Rifugio Croda da Lago at
				around 10:30am.</p>

				<p>Angela, Ben, and I hiked together for the first 8 miles and the views
				were once again gorgeous. It was amazing to see the views of Cortina
				from above. We again mixed it up between hiking and trail running as we
				desired, and also saw some impressive mountain bikers. A light drizzle
				started as we approached Rifugio Citta di Fiume at 12:30pm, where we
				decided to stop for lunch.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-3-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-3-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>More nice views on day three!</i></p>

				<p>I had a good chat today with an older couple from Ann Arbor who had
				stayed at our same hut the previous night. The man had ran the Boston
				Marathon six times already and the woman talked about how the two of
				them had started their trail adventures in their twenties and raised
				their kids to do the same. This AV1 hike was a family trip for the four
				of them (the younger son was my age). The man told me about how he and
				his son had just done a hike together in the Pyrenees (between Spain and
				France). I hope I can still do the stuff they’re doing when I reach
				their age.</p>

				<p>Lunch (gnocchi al ragù) was yummy and Angela, Ben, and I had a convo
				about the meaning of life. The Linzer torte dessert was good too.
				Afterwards, we set back out on the trail, where the weather had turned
				favorable again. We enjoyed more great views until we dropped Ben off at
				Rifugio Staulanza at around 3:20pm. It was fun making a new trail
				friend. Thanks Ben for all the good chats! 🙂</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-3-3.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-3-4.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Alta Via 1 has a lot of varied terrain</i></p>

				<p>Afterwards, Angela and I had a choice to make between proceeding on
				the main road or climbing up the trail. We decided on the trail and it
				was mostly pleasant until we hit another tough muddy downhill stretch.
				It was slippery and annoying, but we made it through and ended up back
				on the road at Palafavera, where we also saw a ski lift. It would be fun
				to visit here again in the winter (in fact the 2026 Winter Olympics will
				be in Cortina!).</p>

				<p>Finally, after the road, we made one last climb up to our hut at
				Coldai. The sun came out again, so we reapplied sunscreen, and also ran
				into the same guy we saw in the rain yesterday (selfie attached). The
				last climb up to the rifugio was among the steepest we’ve trekked so
				far, but the view was just incredible. Hard to describe with words, you
				have to come here to see it with your own eyes. We arrived at Rifugio
				Coldai just before 6pm and took some quick showers (5€ each).</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/coldai-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/coldai-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Amazing view on last climb up to Coldai</i></p>

				<p>Dinner was supposed to be served at 6:30pm, but actual food only came
				out at 7:20pm (which was unfortunate because I was hungry). We had a fun
				chat with a German woman (originally from Bielefeld -- aka the most
				boring city in Germany -- but who had also lived in Paris, New York, and
				Rome before now living in Florence) and her Italian son who just started
				his bachelor’s program in Berlin. We talked about AI, Europe
				vs. America, pasta, and he told me about the Italian phrase “la dolce
				far niente” or “the sweetness of doing nothing”. I feel like I am a very
				go-go-go person in NY, so it was cool to hear his perspective on Italian
				culture. It’s always cool to exchange cultures when meeting people from
				other backgrounds while traveling. 😄 We also ran into the Aussies,
				Oscar and Emma, again after dinner who we might see more of in the next
				two days.</p>

				<p>Overall, it was another fun day out on the trails. I feel like we had
				a lot of good convos today, which I really enjoyed. Maybe that’s what
				life is all about. Anyways, that’s all for today. Another day, another
				opportunity!</p>

				<p>Solo hike day, so lots of time for rumination and self-reflection.
				Didn’t see any other souls for the last three hours on route 554, and
				the feeling was amazing! The silence of nature 💪</p>

				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/lago-coldai-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Taking it slow around Lago Coldai</i></p>

				<p>Got up at 7:15am and went downstairs for breakfast at Rifugio Coldai.
				We decided to do a solo day today, so I set out on my own around 9am and
				made a circuit of Lago Coldai where I took some nice photos. Afterwards,
				I set out towards the southwest and made my way toward Rifugio Tissi for
				the first stop of the day, which required some climbing. I arrived
				around 11am and saw the same Italian family from dinner last night and
				said hi. I debated getting food at this rifugio, but it was still too
				early, so I continued onwards.</p>

				<p>The next stretch was a lot of rocky downhill, which is not a surface
				that I enjoy traversing. The sharp edges of the rocks make it difficult
				to run on, and the scattered larger rocks could easily lead you to go
				flying in the event that you stepped on one the wrong way. Nevertheless,
				I persisted and eventually made it to Rifugio Vazzoler, where I ran into
				Angela as well as Zack / Maryanne from dinner the night before. We had a
				good chat over lunch about restaurants in NYC and how the pandemic
				affected us. For food, I ordered the tagliatelle with ragu as well as a
				chocolate cake for dessert and lemon soda, all of which were yummy. The
				Italian family showed up once again and we all took a selfie (see
				attached)! 😀 Angela left first, and I lost track of time continuing to
				talk to the NYers until I finally headed out at 2:30pm.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/rocky-downhill-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/rocky-downhill-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Annoying rocky downhills</i></p>

				<p>The next stretch started out annoying with yet another rocky downhill
				section, and I also got a little spooked when I saw a sign that said I
				still had 3h30m to go to get to our hut, when it was already 3pm. I
				decided to pick the pace up a bit from then on, and the route also
				became more fun at this point with more rolling elevation and varied
				terrain (both of which I enjoy). There were some sketchy sections where
				if you took the wrong step, you could fall off a cliff and die, so I did
				have to be vigilant here. Decisions “of high consequence” is the term I
				learned from Angela. Nevertheless, it was an exhilirating feeling and it
				reminded me of why hiking can be so fun.</p>

				<p>The solo vs. pair vs. group hiking dynamic was also interesting,
				since I got to experience all three on this trip. I believe that each
				has its own pros and cons. For today’s solo hike, I barely saw any other
				humans for the last three hours. It really is an incredible feeling to
				be in the middle of nature without any other souls in sight, and it
				being so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. This final stretch (route
				554) was one of my favorite stretches of AV1 and I stopped a bunch of
				times here just to soak it all in. So amazing!</p>

				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/route-554-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Route 554, be careful here!</i></p>

				<p>Finally, I got to the hut at around 5:30pm and took a shower before
				dinner was served at 7pm. We chatted outside with a guy from Tennessee
				who really likes skiing / snowboarding in Utah / Colorado. At the dinner
				table, I had lasagna / pork / panna cotta and we chatted with a guy from
				Canada and two really cool German guys, both of whom were very funny.
				They told us they are doing the Trans-Alps hike from Munich to Venice,
				which takes 4+ weeks (they are currently on week 4) and it was really
				cool to hear about their experience. One of the guys kind of looked like
				Josh Allen. 😅 After dinner, we also chatted with an American couple who
				lives in Carroll Gardens (even more fellow New Yorkers!) as well as
				Jelle from the Netherlands (who we saw camping previously a few times
				now).</p>

				<p>Tomorrow is gonna be our longest and final day, so it’s probably a
				good idea to sleep now. Crazy that we’re almost at the finish. This hike
				really has been so much fun. :') Life’s great! Ok, signing off, until
				next time!</p>

				<h2 align=center><b><img src="./flags/italy.png"> Alta Via 1 - Day 5 (79–120km) <img src="./flags/italy.png"></b>
				<p><strong><a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/15359000916">Strava Activity</a></strong></p></h2>

				<p>Alta Via 1 complete! 80+ miles and 25,000+ feet of elevation gain in
				5 days. The best views came on the final day and I ended the day with a
				fast finish, racing an Italian man!</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-5-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/day-5-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Smooth start to the last day</i></p>

				<p>Woke up at 6:15am and packed my bag before breakfast at 7am, so that
				we would be able to leave right after we finished eating, this final day
				being our longest day (best for last!) We departed Rifugio Carestitato
				at 7:40am, our last hut of the hike. 🥲</p>

				<p>The first part of the day went by quite smoothly and we made it to
				Paso Duran (82km) rather quickly. After a brief stretch running on the
				road, we started a climb. At 10am, I got viciously charged at by an
				offleash dog, and I saw my life flash before my eyes. Luckily, the dog
				did not attack me and I told the dog’s owner who was apologizing that
				it’s okay. That episode was a bit too much excitement, though, even for
				me.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/pramperet-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/pramperet-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>In the clouds and cute mountain kitty</i></p>

				<p>Afterwards, we continued climbing until we made it to Rifugio
				Pramperet at 11am, where we grabbed a quick bite and had a ham + cheese
				sandwich (I wish they had mayo or any dressing -- why do Italians like
				all their breads so plain?) and a crostata (which was delicious). There
				was also a cute mountain kitty at this rifugio! We made it quick and by
				11:40am, we were back on the trail.</p>

				<p>The next part of the trail was arguably the best part of the whole
				AV1. We made a big climb up route 514 and saw mountain chain after
				mountain chain in every direction. We chatted a bit with a Korean guy we
				had seen from earlier (ahn young ha se yo!) and took some pictures
				before climbing even higher onto a ridge that I consider to be one of
				the best views I’ve ever seen. The weather was perfect, the view was
				perfect, and it all made me really happy! 😀</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/peak-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/peak-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>On top of the world! ⛰️</i></p>

				<p>I dilly-dallied for maybe a bit too long admiring the view and had to
				run to catch up. This was probably one of the most treacherous parts of
				the hike as well, with AJ and Regina from last night’s hut describing it
				as “hiking on a razor’s edge”. Nevertheless, we made slow and steady
				progress and continued on our way down through more marvelous
				landscapes. We also filmed some fun trail running footage (promotional
				materials, anyone?).</p>

				<p>At 1pm, we started our massive 6,000+ ft descent as we entered the
				clouds. This is the biggest descent I’ve ever done, and despite my best
				efforts to trail run as much of it as possible, my knees were still not
				happy with all the downhill load. We made a quick stop at Rifugio Pian
				de Fontana at 2pm, but with no time to spare, continued onward after
				just a short break. We continued to make slow and steady progress,
				trying to catch one of the 4:27 or 5:27 buses at La Pissa.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/into-the-clouds-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/into-the-clouds-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>The descent into the clouds</i></p>

				<p>At around 3:30pm, when we still had around 4 miles and 1,200 ft of
				elevation descent to go, I said we could probably make the 4:27 bus at
				La Pissa, but Angela said she didn’t believe me and I considered taking
				it on as a challenge. After initial hesitation, I decided to go for it
				around 4pm and started hybrid hiking / trail running around a 15min/mi
				pace. That’s when a random Italian man started running behind me and I
				decided I should race him to the finish.</p>

				<p>The man was relentless and didn’t seem to stop for anything, and I
				ended up running my first sub-10, then first sub-8 minute miles of the
				entire hike. He pushed me hard, but damn, running downhill down the
				trail was fun. I think I particularly enjoyed the fast decision making
				part of the process, where you have to be both fast and careful with
				deciding every single next step. Maybe trail running is where it’s at
				after all. 🤔 I ended up making it to the road at La Pissa, the official
				end of Alta Via 1 at 4:25pm. 80+ miles and 25,000+ feet of elevation
				gain in 5 days, officially done! 🥳</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/italian-man-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/italian-man-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Alright, let's race 🏃‍♂️💨</i></p>

				<p>Next, I backtracked on the trail to find Angela again (and to get in
				some extra mileage / vert hehe), and we finished the route together
				before waiting for the 5:27 bus to Belluno. We chatted with a cool
				Australian lady from Perth who we had seen earlier on the descent to
				Lagozuoi, who mentioned she was doing some hikes while spending time in
				Italy with her partner’s family in Bologna (they first met in Bali 😅),
				although the husband and kids were at the beach.</p>

				<p>After we arrived at Belluno, we were starving and got pizza and
				gelato (very yum), as well as sushi and more candy. Annoyingly, we
				either missed the 6:30pm bus to Calalzo or it just never came, and we
				were only able to leave Belluno on the 7:15pm bus (number 009). The
				sushi restaurant was interesting because the owners only spoke Italian
				and Chinese, and no English (I always found this to be cool).</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/pizza.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/gelato.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Finally some food -- pizza and gelato!</i></p>

				<p>It took another hour to get to Calalzo, and there was supposed to be
				a 8:50pm bus that would bring us back to Cortina (where we left our
				bags), but it appears the bus just never came. Furthermore, none of the
				taxi operators were still working and we kept getting directed to
				calling the same random Italian guys on the phone, who kept telling us
				they were busy (annoying, but probably fair since it was past 9pm).
				Finally, Angela was able to connect with one guy (shoutout to Giovanni),
				who was willing to drive down to Calalzo to pick us up and drive us back
				to Cortina, albeit at a quite steep price. We took the L and agreed to
				it.</p>

				<p>I layed down on the bench outside the train station, and dozed off
				until the taxi finally picked us up at 11pm, with us finally reaching
				the hotel at midnight. It was the end to a very long day, as well as an
				even longer but incredible five-day fastpacking experience through the
				many varied landscapes of the Dolomites. Kind of crazy how much happened
				in such a short timespan!</p>

				<img src="./photos/fastpacking-alta-via-1/calalzo-2.png" width="180px" height="386px"><br><i>Somebody please pick up the phone</i></p>

				<p>There will probably be more thoughts to come, and I will try to write
				a blog post on my AV1 experience, but for now I would just like to thank
				Angela for being a great trail partner / friend! I would also definitely
				recommend AV1 for anyone that’s interested. That’s all for now and
				thanks for reading / following along if you’ve made it this far. :)</p>
				<p>Until next time! 😴</p>

				<h2 align=center><b>Reflections on the Trip</b></h2>

				<p>Reflecting on the trip over a month out, hiking Alta Via 1 was a
				great life experience for me. It was a great first experience for my
				first multi-day hike and I learned a lot about hiking, trail running, and
				myself.</p>

				<p>In terms of what I would do differently from a packing perspective, I
				think not bringing an actual waterproof layer was definitely a miss on
				my part, and potentially a bit dangerous on day 2 since I had to keep
				moving to keep warm until I got to the hut. Hiking poles could be an
				improvement for next time, although I think I got more fitness gains by
				not using the poles. I noticed that without poles, on the uphills, my
				calves took a lot of the load while on the downhills, my glutes took a
				lot of the load.</p>

				<p>For gear, none of the stuff I bought from REI ended up
				being used, but I was told that if you could only bring two things on a
				hike, it would be a water filter and a headlamp, so I think bringing
				those was still important even if they weren’t used on this trip. Angela
				had a very nice universal charger that had tons of ports, which I think
				could be useful for a future trip so that I can charge more things at
				once (the classic traveling x charging problem). I could have been more
				careful not to lose two shirts at the second rifugio (when I hung all my
				wet clothes out to dry, I forgot to take two of them when we left early
				that next morning).</p>

				<p>For the bag size, 20L was good sizing in my opinion,
				although the Australians we met, Oscar and Emma, managed to impressively
				fastpack it with only 12L bags. I think if I squeezed my stuff, maybe I
				could have gone a little smaller, but 20L was also fine.</p>

				<p>For navigation, I used the <a href="https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap/personal-heatmap">Strava global heatmap</a> which worked quite well for
				most of the hike (it works even when you don’t have service). I didn’t
				load any of the routes onto my Apple Watch, which Angela was able to do
				on her Garmin fēnix 7S Pro. I’ve heard you can do this on an Apple Watch
				by downloading the third-party WorkOutdoors app, but I haven’t explored
				that option. Many of the people we met on the hike also used this app
				called Komoot, which is apparently popular in Europe. Apart from hiking,
				other cool things you can do in the area are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Via_ferrata">via ferrata</a> (literally: iron path)
				climbing in the summer and skiing / snowboarding in the winter, which
				would both be cool to check out in potential future trips. We also chose
				to do the hike from north to south, but apparently some people also do
				it south to north (although it seems less common).</p>

				<p>In terms of food, it was cool to see the food options start more
				German as we started closer to the Austrian border and become more
				Italian as we went south deeper into Italy. In my opinion, the food at
				the rifugios was quite good (apart from this dish called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speck">speck</a> that is similar to prosciutto, but in
				my opinion strictly worse and which I did not like) and it made it a lot
				easier not having to carry tons of food in my backpack. The portion sizes maybe could have been a little bigger. The rifugios
				also had water, which meant I didn’t even use my water filter, opting
				instead to just drink a lot of water during meals and refilling my
				bottles / buying new bottles along the way. I only carried one liter of
				water at a time (two 0.5L bottles, one on each shoulder strap) which was
				sufficient for the first four days. The last day was the hottest and
				required the most refills, so I probably drank at least 3-4L of water
				that day.</p>

				<p>It was very fun meeting a bunch of new people out on the trail and
				hearing about all the other hikes they’ve done before and it has
				inspired me to do another multi-day hike sometime in the future. I had
				done some longer day hikes in the Alps before, in the Interlaken /
				Lauterbrunnen valley area of Switzerland as well as Mount Panorama in
				Kazakhstan, but multi-day hikes feel even more exciting to me now. Every morning that I
				woke up, it felt amazing to feel so free in the mountains and it’s
				really a feeling that you don’t get to experience living in NYC. On the
				fourth day in particular, I remember standing by myself with no one in
				sight and taking in the silence all to myself. It was awesome. For
				future trips, there seem to be plenty of options, with the more popular
				options ranging from TMB to Patagonia to the American West and perhaps
				less explored options ranging from the Pyrenees to Central Asia to Japan, and even more unexplored options that I’m not even familiar with yet!</p>

				<h2 align=center><b>Reflections on My Life</b></h2>

				<p>This trip also led me to reflect more on my current lifestyle in NYC.
				I am someone who lives an active lifestyle in the city, where I like to
				do at least one physical activity every day and enjoy spending time
				outdoors. I love many things about my New York lifestyle and it will
				always be home for me, but the reality is that it’s not the best place
				for some of the activities I enjoy, like hiking and biking (I’m tired of
				9W -- I guess Central Park loops are fine). It was cool to hear Angela tell me
				stories of people living full-time in Chamonix with elite access to the
				mountains. Places like Switzerland, Japan, or the American West (like
				Seattle, Colorado, or Utah) also seem great for living out this type of
				lifestyle.</p>

				<p>Another reflection I had is that I have been very social in New York
				over the past year, but I also enjoy alone time
				and want to be more intentional about carving that into my schedule. As
				someone who seems to flip flop between being an introvert and extrovert,
				I find myself both energized by people and enjoying time for self-reflection. With all that’s gone on in my life in the past couple
				months, I didn’t get a chance (or at least didn’t commit) to writing this
				blog post until now. Interestingly, more of my friends seem to be
				getting into writing and content creation lately (similar to why I wrote
				my <a href="https://fjlin.me/why-im-writing-more-in-2025.html">Why I Want To Write More in 2025</a> blog post earlier this year).
				Yesterday, my friend Eric shared with me a Substack post he made yesterday about
				<a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-167239509">why he runs</a> which triggered
				me to finally sit down and write this post today. You can also check out
				Angela’s Substack at <a href="https://maountains.substack.com/">Maountains</a>. Anyways, if you’ve made it this far,
				I hope you enjoyed reading and as always, please feel free to reach
				out to me via e-mail / Instagram / whatever platform if you have any
				questions, comments, or just wanted to chat. Until next time!</p>
