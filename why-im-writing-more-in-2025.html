				<h1>Why I'm Writing More in 2025</h1>
				<div class="chunk">
				<p>One of my many goals for 2025 is to write more. Historically, I have
				always been a big consumer of media. Some might even say I’m <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremely_online">extremely
				online</a>. However, I have mostly always been a consumer of media,
				whether that’s as a lurker on Reddit, Twitter/X, YouTube, or beyond. And
				according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule">1%
				rule</a> of Internet culture, “90% of the participants of a community
				only consume content, 9% of the participants change or update content,
				and 1% of the participants add content.” So it’s pretty normal for the
				vast majority of people to only consume content.</p>
				
				<p>The reasons why I want to write more are manifold. Firstly, I think
				it’s a good way to force myself to organize my thinking. I always have a
				ton of unstructured thoughts floating around my mind at any given moment
				in time about all sorts of unrelated topics. Without writing things
				down, these varied thoughts occupy a lot of mindspace, which also means
				costly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch">context
				switching</a> between them. By writing things down, I’m forced to bring
				structure to my thoughts and articulate what exactly is on my mind. If
				my thoughts weren’t fully formulated yet on a matter, it forces me to
				figure out what exactly I mean to say. The hope is that after my
				thoughts are written down, the vacated mindspace can be cleared for new
				thoughts and ideas.</p>
				
				<p>I also think of writing thoughts down as similar to the concept of
				using <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)">pointers</a>
				in computer programming. For example, last year in 2024 many people
				asked me variations of the same question, “how can I get better at
				running?” Instead of repeating similar responses to many different
				people, I thought it would be more productive to summarize my thoughts
				in a single comprehensive post, which led to my <a
				href="https://fjlin.me/running-learnings">first blog post</a> a few
				weeks back. This way, there’s a single point of reference for people who
				are interested in my answer to this question, and it can also serve as a
				living document that can be iterated upon and shared.</p>
				
				<p>In a modern world where short-form videos and tweets dominate
				people’s attention more than ever, I think there’s tons of value in
				long-form online content as a medium for the exchange of thoughts and
				ideas. Despite information being easier to access now than it’s ever
				been in history, the Internet is dealing with a proliferation of <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">doomscrolling</a>, <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_rot">brainrot</a>, and now <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop">AI slop</a>. As a result,
				the synthesization of actually useful ideas is as valuable as it’s ever
				been. I’m also reminded of this <a
				href="https://x.com/kevinakwok/status/998382426270318593">seven-year old
				tweet</a> about a mental representation for Twitter, which is that it’s
				like “tapping a tuning fork and seeing who resonates.” I think of
				writing in a similar way. Many people may not care about or resonate
				with any single particular piece of online writing, but for those who
				do, it can provoke a novel line of thought or lead to an interesting
				conversation down the line.</p>
				
				<p>In terms of my personal interests, back in school, despite taking
				creative writing classes, AP English, etc., I was never a big fan of
				academic writing. However, I view personal writing as a different type
				of exercise, which I enjoy more. In college, for example, I enjoyed
				journaling in the form of <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness">stream of
				consciousness</a> writing. When it comes to online vs offline writing, I
				also considered whether I want to write more offline (i.e. pen + paper),
				which has the benefit of forcing you to be even more efficient with your
				words. However, some downsides are that it’s slower to write, harder to
				edit, harder to search, and harder to share, so I decided to go with the
				online approach. (Fun fact: before I was into chess and running, I was
				into <a href="http://typeracer.com">speedtyping</a>, peaking at around
				avg 140 wpm / max 192 wpm, so I still have some of that in me…)</p>
				
				<p>Lastly, I’ve motivated to write and work on my website because of
				friends I know whose websites I’m inspired by (e.g. <a
				href="https://www.natecation.com/">Natecation</a>, <a
				href="https://iafisher.com/">iafisher</a>, <a
				href="https://jyotirmai.me/writings.html">Jyo</a>) as well as public
				writing I’ve read online (e.g. <a
				href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">Tim Urban</a>,
				<a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html">Paul Graham</a>, <a
				href="https://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/">Andrej
				Karpathy</a>). Even though I first set this personal website up all the
				way back in <a href="https://fjlin.me/studies">college</a>, I haven’t
				touched it much since graduating. My reason for reviving it is that I
				think personal websites are a cool way to have your own “corner of the
				Internet”. We’re lucky to live in a time when basically anyone with
				access to a phone or computer can have their own platform, for better or
				for worse. Anyways, I have many more ideas for what I want to write
				about, so I hope I can make this a regular exercise. As always, I’m open
				to feedback, so let me know if you’ve read this far and this post
				inspires you to write or if you have your own thoughts on why writing is
				important. Until next time!</p>
