				<h1>Noma</h1>
				<div class="chunk">
				<p>I recently made a trip to Copenhagen to run the 2025 Copenhagen
				Marathon and leading up to the race, I tacked on some additional
				traveling in London and Oslo. Even prior to my last trip to Copenhagen
				in 2022, I knew the city was home to <a
				href="https://noma.dk/">Noma</a>, the <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noma_(restaurant)">“best restaurant
				in the world”</a>. I knew multiple friends who had gotten a reservation
				and made trips to Copenhagen just to check out the experience before, so
				after I got to Europe, I was a bit curious if I could get a reservation
				on late notice myself. As luck would have it, my friend and I signed up
				for Tock (similar to Resy) notifications and got a slot off a last minute cancellation two
				days before, and I had ten minutes to decide whether I wanted to go.
				Given that (1) I had heard positive reviews about this restaurant for
				years, (2) people have been making entire trips to Copenhagen just to
				visit this restaurant and I was already going to be in the area, and (3)
				I like trying new things, I decided after maybe 3-4 minutes that going
				would be the right call, and we secured the res.</p>

				<p>My travel style is generally pretty flexible, and originally, I was
				going to split up the bus / train ride from Oslo to Copenhagen (~8 hour
				journey) with an overnight stay in Gothenberg, Sweden (which is
				conveniently located around halfway between the two cities). When we got
				the lunch reservation, however, I decided it wasn’t worth the risk of
				trying to make it to Copenhagen the morning of (in case there were any
				transit delays) and potentially missing the reservation altogether. So I
				decided it would be better to arrive the night before, which is what I
				did. After a lazy Friday morning, I used the local <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Republic">Donkey Republic</a>
				bikeshare to ride over to the restaurant located at Refshalevej, in a
				formerly industrial turned new hip area annexed by Amager Island.</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="./photos/noma/waiting-area-1.jpg" width="290px" height="386px">
				<img src="./photos/noma/waiting-area-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Indoor + outdoor waiting areas</i></p>

				<p>After arriving at the restaurant, there was a sunroom waiting area
				where we checked in and waited to be brought to the main dining area.
				Before going to the restaurant, I had done some research and watched a
				video on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Redzepi">René
				Redzepi</a>, the chef and co-owner of the <a
				href="http://restaurant.As">restaurant.</a> As we waited in the
				secondary outdoor waiting area, René himself came out – the other guests
				seemed either surprised or didn’t recognize him, so I decided I should
				break the ice and ask for a picture with him, which would also be a nice
				addition to my <a href="https://fjlin.me/selfies">selfie collection</a>.
				During this time, his dogs also came out and roamed around the premises,
				which further contributed to the homely vibes. Initially, I felt a
				little underdressed for the occasion since I didn’t expect to be going
				to some fancy Michelin 3-star restaurant on this trip, but after meeting
				René, I realized I was dressed no more casually than him or some of the
				other guests, and plus I noticed Arcteryx (and Carhartt) seemed quite
				popular in the Nordics anyways.</p>

				<img src="./photos/noma/rene-dog.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Me, René Redzepi, and his dog</i></p>

				<p>At last, we were led into the dining area, where each guest got a
				reception by the staff as they walked to their assigned table. There
				were about fifteen tables in the dining area which ranged from seating
				2-8 guests, as well as one large shared table that guests can sign up
				for to be seated with other randos (which would also have been a
				cool way to meet people). As we sat down, the staff brought out a spread
				of all the ingredients that were going to be used for the preparation
				for the meal. This included a large king crab which I asked to take a
				picture with! The waiters and waitresses were all super friendly, and it
				was clear they came from all around the world for an opportunity to work
				at this esteemed restaurant. When I mentioned I was running the
				marathon, I got a lot of questions from the staff about my running
				experiences, with several of them sharing that they had run their own
				half-marathons recently as well.</p>

				<img src="./photos/noma/crab.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Ingredient spread and a king crab!</i></p>

				<p>They then took away the ingredients and we started getting served the
				food. The main idea behind the food at Noma is that it was one of the
				original pioneers of a new culinary movement called <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Nordic_Cuisine">New Nordic
				Cuisine</a>, with the main principle being the usage of local,
				in-season ingredients for the preparation of the dishes. Noma has three
				“seasons” (Ocean, Vegetable, Forest &amp; Game), where they serve
				different types of food, with my visit taking place during the Ocean
				Season – hence the focus on seafood dishes. With each dish being served,
				there was a lengthy explanation of the origins of the dishes as well as
				how it was intended to be consumed, either by a waiter, waitress, or
				chef. We also got the juice pairing, so each dish came with a juice that
				was intended to complement the dish. In particular, Noma has its own
				fermentation lab, so there seemed to be a lot of experimentation with
				fermentation in the juices. All in all, there were 16 dishes that were
				served over the course of around 3 and a half hours.</p>

				<p>Overall, it was clear that there was a lot of effort put into the
				presentation and taste of the dishes, and the goal was for each of the
				dishes to have unique flavors that guests haven’t experienced before in
				their lifetimes. The dishes that I liked the most were the crab broth
				(that I drank from a crab shell), the seared scallop (I am a big scallop
				fan), and the hazelnut ice cream dessert (probably one of the best ice
				creams I’ve had). The dishes that I liked the least were the mussel soup
				(covered in seaweed) which literally tasted like ocean water, the
				pickles (which were too salty and pickley for my liking), and a fruit
				leather (which was basically just a fruit roll-up). There was one
				particularly provocative dish where a cooked snail was served alongside
				a living snail that kept crawling off our plates (the live snail was not
				for consumption).</p>

				<img src="./photos/noma/tour-2.jpg" width="290px" height="386px"><br><i>Open Kitchen</i></p>

				<p>After the meal was finished, there was a kitchen tour and we got to
				see the open kitchen quarters where the chefs were preparing the dishes
				as well as the cafeteria where the staff was resting and eating food.
				During the meal, it was interesting to observe that some of the tables
				next to us were occupied by restaurant owners, e.g. one table next to us
				was occupied by the owner of a restaurant in Hong Kong, presumably
				seeking inspiration and ideas for the operation of their own
				restaurants. I noticed during the kitchen tour that some Chinese guy
				next to me started chatting up one of the Chinese chefs and exchanged
				WeChats with him, so it looks like it was a good networking opportunity
				for some individuals too.</p>

				<h2 align=center><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>
				<p>To conclude, I think the way to view Noma is less of a restaurant and
				more of a spectacle / show, where the food is just the side piece. I
				would describe the meal itself as merely fine, and from a pure
				nourishment perspective, I think the $12 pasta that I had at the random
				Italian restaurant in Gothenberg train station the day before was
				probably better and more filling overall (as well as better for my
				marathon carb load). The service was indeed impressive, and it was cool
				to witness how much care was being put into the production and serving
				of each dish. After we left, they also gave each guest a <a
				href="https://nomaprojects.com/products/mushroom-garum">mushroom
				garum</a> to bring home. Overall, from a value perspective, I’d probably
				value it at something like $200-300 rather than $900, but I would 
				say it was still worth the experience to go once. Yolo.</p>
				<p>For those inspired by this post, you can also make a trip to
				Copenhagen to check out either Noma or some of the other popular fine
				dining experiences like <a href="https://alchemist.dk/">Alchemist</a>
				and <a href="https://www.geranium.dk/">Geranium</a>. Or for those hoping
				to stay closer to home, there is apparently a restaurant in New York
				opened by one of the co-founders of Noma called <a
				href="https://ny.eater.com/2024/1/22/24043047/ilis-greenpoint-review">Ilis</a>
				(which is also more reasonably priced) that might be worth checking out.
				For me personally, I think the experience has inspired me to try out
				some other fine dining restaurants every once in a while. Have you ever
				had a unique dining experience that you enjoyed? Feel free to reach out
				and let me know about your experience!</p>
