		<h1>Edinburgh ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</h1>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/FjJ5WQL.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Welcome to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland! Nicknamed Athens of the North, Edinburgh is located just a few miles from the North Sea and said to be built on seven hills just like Rome. At the very center of the city stands the imposing Edinburgh Castle situated on Castle Rock. Historically, the site has been occupied by humans for almost two millennia, with there being a castle built on it for almost one millennium.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/dPOkjli.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Edinburgh Castle is the cityâ€™s most popular tourist attraction, which makes sense given its prominence. The castle has an important history in the context of Anglo-Scottish conflicts, playing a role in the fourteenth century Wars of Scottish Independence and sixteenth century Battle of Flodden Field. Today, tourists from around the world flood the castle to explore its ancient buildings and attractive views.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Hp5r9BT.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Royal Mile, or Ryal Mile in Scots, is the main thoroughfare in the old town of Edinburgh. It leads from Edinburgh Castle in the west all the way to Holyrood Palace in the east, spanning approximately one Scots mile (around 1.1 US miles). Radiating from the Royal Mile are a series of "closes" or small alleyways between tenement buildings. Historically, the Mile was also home to a large open marketplace.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/vnX2JVC.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Holyrood Park is the royal park located in the east of Edinburgh, which is also home to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official Scottish residence of the royals. The park was created in the 1500s and is home to many hills and cliffs, including Arthurâ€™s Seat.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/XzszVUF.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Holyrood Park is also known for its geological significance. The Salisbury Crags are cliffs found in the west of Holyrood Park along the Radical Road (named after the early nineteenth century Radical War). In the past, the Salisbury Crags was a popular place for rock climbers, although climbing has been limited in recent years.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/HgSoQHO.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Arthur's Seat is the highest point in Edinburgh and the pinnacle of Holyrood Park, towering over the city and its surrounding areas. Many believe that the peakâ€™s name originates from King Arthur himself. Given its location, some also believe that the site carries religious significance.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/rd3L56u.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Arthur's Seat is 251 meters in height, giving impressive views of not only Edinburgh, but also the North Sea coast located to the north and east. From above, itâ€™s difficult not to appreciate the cityâ€™s natural beauty.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Zqcm9hn.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Portobello is a Scottish former coastal town, although today it composes part of the suburbs of Edinburgh. The North Sea that Portobello is situated on stretches eastward all the way to Norway and is economically significant for its oil, gas, and fisheries. Portobello Beach in particular, as seen in this picture, is a nice place to sit down, relax, and eat some fish and chips.</p>

		<p class="captions">Some of the first skyscrapers housing in the world was constructed in Edinburgh in the seventeenth century. Taking a stroll around the city, one can still find many examples of old stone houses built on hills, which give off unique vibes.</p>

		<p class="captions">Victoria Quay is one of the several Scottish Government buildings located around Edinburgh. To give some history of Scotland, it used to be its own sovereign state until the Acts of Union in 1707 which unified it with England. Since then, it has existed as a constituent country of the United Kingdom. In recent years, Scotland has gained increasing power, with a 1997 referendum resulting in the establishment of an independent Scottish Parliament.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/f7Z2RaO.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Royal Yacht Britannia was the former royal yacht of Queen Elizabeth II for over four decades. Located at the Leith Docks in northern Edinburgh, it has been transformed into a museum ship where one can explore the history of the vessel. Over its many years of use, the yacht accumulated over one million miles during its hundreds of state visits around the world.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/lq6qSqV.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The State Dining Room was the main dining room of the ship, where it hosted many kings, queens, and world leaders over the years. Although the Royal Yacht Britannia was the eighty third royal yacht of the British monarchy, it was determined that there would be no replacement vessel after its decommissioning in 1997. The shipâ€™s final official visit was to Hong Kong during the Hong Kong Handover.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/nqNJXlC.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Scottish Parliament building can be found in a particularly fascinating location right beneath Holyrood Park and Arthurâ€™s Seat. It is a relatively new building, with construction having only finished in 2004. Its location has come to symbolize the connection between the Scottish landscape and people.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Q4kWmrE.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The building itself is also known for its unique and award-winning architectural design. The original designer sought to create a building that would represent Scottish identity, particularly after the recent 1997 devolution referendum.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/3fyyvDa.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The National Monument of Scotland is a national memorial to the Scottish casualties of the Napoleonic Wars, located on Edinburghâ€™s Calton Hill alongside the Nelson Monument. Calton Hill is one of the seven hills that Edinburgh is described to have been built on.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/N6jVOxW.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">To conclude, Edinburgh is truly an impressive city with both unique historical and natural elements. As the city continues to develop, it retains its important identity as the center of Scottish culture. For anyone considering a visit, I would highly recommend it!</p>
