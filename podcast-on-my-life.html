				<p>Recently, my friend showed me <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">NotebookLM</a>, a tool developed by Google that uses Gemini to interact with document sources to generate summaries, analyses, explanations, and more.</p>
				<p>I uploaded the pages on my personal website (the one you're reading right now) to NotebookLM to generate a podcast episode about my life, and played around with some prompt engineering to see what different outputs it could produce. I was impressed with the results, in particular its ability to make the discussion sound so natural and conversational with ad-libs!</p>
				<p>I ended up liking the following audio clip the most and uploaded it to YouTube. Feel free to check it out if you're interested!</p>

				<p>Have you ever used AI to generate something cool or that you're proud of? Let me know if you have!</p>
