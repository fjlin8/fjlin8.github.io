			<h1>Cardiff ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§</h1>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Gcp0HZL.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Cardiff is the capital and largest city of Wales, another of the constituent countries of the UK. Located right in the middle of the city is Millennium Stadium (Stadiwm y Mileniwm), which is the national stadium of Wales. It houses the national rugby team and sits right along the banks of the River Taff. The stadium was built to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/ogxhKov.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">St. Mary Street (Heol Eglwys Fair) is one of the main streets in downtown Cardiff, which is lined by Welsh flags. At night, the streetâ€™s bustling bars and restaurants attract large crowds. At one terminus of the street sits Cardiff Central Station and at the other sits Cardiff Castle.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/SxDjbpl.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Cardiff Castle (Castell Caerdydd) is a castle located right beside the city center of Cardiff. The location was originally used by the Romans as a fort almost two millennia ago. The first castle on the site was built later in the eleventh century.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/eFJMMtk.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Cardiff Castle is a traditional motte-and-bailey castle, with a shell keep, as seen in this picture. The forty foot tall motte was built by the Normans after their invasion of Wales in the eleventh century and it withstood numerous attacks in the subsequent years. It continued to exchange hands between many noble families over the years until it came to the Bute family, who held onto it from the mid-eighteenth century onward.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/zmI66SO.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Notably, the tunnels of Cardiff Castle were actually converted into bomb shelters during World War II to protect Welsh citizens against German bombing raids. The tunnels were enough to protect almost two thousand people and even contained bunk beds and kitchens.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/DmgfiMY.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Yet at the same time, one can still find remnants of the original Roman north gate, which became incorporated into Cardiff Castle. The lighter-colored stones at the bottom of the gate are original stones from the entrance to the Roman fort.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/s4s0PpR.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Cardiff Market (Marchnad Caerdydd) is an indoor Victorian-era shopping market located in the city center. Before the construction of the market, this location was the site of the Cardiff Gaol prison and its gallows.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/o9yAHIQ.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Cardiff Story Museum (Amgueddfa Stori Caerdydd) was a great place to learn a bit about the history of the city. Despite its extensive history, Cardiff actually only became a city in 1905 and itâ€™s also Europeâ€™s newest capital city (having become capital of Wales in 1955). It gained its prominence as a major port for coal that attracted ships from across the world, resulting in a multicultural scene.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/9opxWtv.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Wales Millenium Centre (Canolfan Mileniwm Cymru) is another modern building located at Cardiff Bay (Bae Caerdydd). Completed less than a decade ago, it serves as an arts center with a theater, shops, and restaurants. The building has become one of the landmarks of Cardiff in recent years, symbolizing the cityâ€™s rapid growth.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/7oVBnj7.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Senedd building is the home of the National Assembly for Wales (Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru). Just like the Millennium Centre, the building was only completed ten years ago and has a unique, modern appearance. It directly faces Cardiff Bay and is located on the site of the former Cardiff Docks.</p>

			<p class="captions">A bigger picture of Cardiff Bay (Bae Caerdydd) can be seen here. After the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage, the bay has completely transformed by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. The bay is a little over a mile from the city center and showcases the great development that the city has undergone in recent years.</p>

			<p class="captions">Cardiff is truly unlike many of the other major cities that Iâ€™ve visited in the past few weeks, and it is special in its own way. The combination of its Roman history, Norman history, and modern developments is fascinating and makes it a popular alternative tourist destination. It will be interesting to see how Cardiff will continue to inevitably change in coming years!</p>
