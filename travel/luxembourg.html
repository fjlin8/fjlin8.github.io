			<h1>Luxembourg ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º</h1>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/foXp9tT.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">My day trip to Luxembourg City, or simply Luxembourg, began at the central train station of Gare de Luxembourg. The city itself is the capital of the country, also named Luxembourg, and is located centrally between the cities of Brussels, Paris, and Frankfurt. The country of Luxembourg is quite small and its official languages are French, German, and Luxembourgish.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/RAwWCtT.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">One of the industries that Luxembourg is known for is banking, the countryâ€™s largest economic sector. The sectorâ€™s growth is attributed to the countryâ€™s advantageous location and high political stability. In this picture, you can see one of Luxembourgâ€™s banks, namely the Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/xmQnsgR.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Place de la Constitution, or Constitution Square, is located in the central Ville Haute quarter of Luxembourg. Historically, Luxembourg was known for being a fortress city, and today, many remnants of the cityâ€™s past are still visible. In this picture, you can see the gardens beneath the Place de la Constitution, as well as numerous Luxembourgish flags.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/gHPylqe.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The day that I visited Luxembourg was actually FÃªte de la Musique, or World Music Day, which Luxembourg celebrates. As a result, there were numerous concerts going on in locations around the city, including this one at the at the Place d'Armes. The Place dâ€™Armes, originally a military parade ground, is now a central square in the old town district.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/QmXbepd.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Located at the Place d'Armes is the Cercle Municipal or Cercle-CitÃ© (City Palace), which was built in the early twentieth century. At one point in history, it hosted the European Court of Justice, and today it serves as a venue for ceremonies and other cultural events.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/XqbVNTR.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The view of Luxembourg from the MontÃ©e de Pfaffenthal. Luxembourg is a really unique city in that there are two valleys that run right through it: the PÃ©trusse and the Alzette. In this picture, you can see the Alzette River on the right-hand side, and the steep cliffs that stand right beside it.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/CXC6b8M.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Because Luxembourg is such an elevated city, it also has many bridges, such as the Pont du ChÃ¢teau seen in this picture. The Pont du ChÃ¢teau is a two-story bridge which connects the old town to the Bock fortifications that protected the city historically. The bridge was built in 1735, when Luxembourg was still under Austrian rule.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/EAsfjdD.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Passerelle or Old Bridge is a viaduct in Luxembourg that spans the PÃ©trusse valley. It connects the old city with the southern part of Luxembourg. As stated earlier, the city is very fascinating with its many different levels and bridges, connecting each of the different parts of the city!</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/2jSYNxB.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">This is the so-called Hollow Tooth tower, a ruin that used to be part of the Bock fortifications. The Bock cliff towers right over the Alzette river valley, and the views from above are simply stunning.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/rSQSsvm.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">One of the main buildings that can be seen across the Alzette is the Saint-Jean-du-Grund complex located in the Grund/Gronn quarter of the city. The church was built around four centuries ago and continues to stand today as a vestige of Baroque and Renaissance architecture.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/LaonDKZ.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">One of coolest places you can visit in Luxembourg is the Casemates du Bock, a series of tunnels that were dug by the Spanish in the seventeenth century. Their original purpose was for city defense, and you can still see some cannons today. Imagine how difficult it mustâ€™ve been to build this complex system of tunnels with the technology of the time!</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/P0WqLW2.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Luxembourg is heavily defined by its historic significance as a fortress city. Over the course of many centuries, the city has been ruled by many different groups, including the Romans, the Burgundians, the Habsburgs, the French, and the Germans.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/lNT0Gcn.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Palais Grand-Ducal or Grand-Ducal Palace is the official palace of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg. In front of the building, a Luxembourgish guard marches back and forth. It was originally constructed in the late sixteenth century as a city hall and has since been renovated several times, including once in recent years.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/JaSscPU.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The GÃ«lle Fra or Monument du Souvenir is a monument of remembrance located at the Place de la Constitution. It commemorates the Luxembourgers who fought in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. Behind the monument, one finds the garden seen earlier and a stunning view of the PÃ©trusse Valley.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/GVJpvaY.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">The Monument de la Solidarite Nationale or National Monument of Solidarity is another monument which commemorates the dead of World War II, in which Luxembourg participated in the fight against the Nazis. In front of the monument, an eternal flame burns.</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/aDP6YcA.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Another view of the Passerelle from the Cite Judiciaire, or Judiciary City. I think that Luxembourg is best described as a city with floors, as seen in this picture and the next, which makes it all the more incredible that a city was built here at all. Everywhere you look in this city, you find magnificent views!</p>
			<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/3pl5dE6.jpg"></p>
			<p class="captions">Luxembourg was one of my favorite places that I visited on my trip and certainly one of the most beautiful. With far less tourists than the major cities of Europe, itâ€™s a nice retreat from the large touristy crowds. Itâ€™s also just a great place to wander around for hours, admiring all the history and natural beauty the city has to offer. If only I had stayed there for more than a few hours!</p>
