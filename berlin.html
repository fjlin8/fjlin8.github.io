		<h1>Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª</h1>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/mrybk40.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Welcome to Berlin with a view of the massive Berlin Cathedral, or Berliner Dom, located on Museumsinsel (Museum Island). Berlin is the capital of Germany, as well as one of the most populous cities in Europe. Itâ€™s a very cosmopolitan city, but I think its most interesting feature is its history; until 1989, less than three decades ago, Berlin was divided by the Berlin Wall. As a result, even today its effects are still apparent.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Js5gSwE.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Brandenburger Tor, or Brandenburg Gate, is one of Berlinâ€™s most popular landmarks and is located at the western end of the boulevard, Unter den Linden. It was originally designed as a sign of peace in the eighteenth century by Frederick William II, but is now commonly associated with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Today, it serves as a symbol of unity for the city.</p>

		<p class="captions">The Reichstag building is the meeting place of the German Parliament, the Bundestag. Its historical significance comes from being the former home of the Imperial Diet until the famous Reichstag fire of 1933. Not until official reunification of Germany in 1990 did the German Parliament return to Berlin (from the then-capital, Bonn) and thus the Reichstag building.</p>

		<p class="captions">The SiegessÃ¤ule, or Berlin Victory Column, is a monument located at the western end of the famous StraÃŸe des 17. Juni. It actually used to serve as a monument to Prussian war victories while standing in a different location, but was then relocated by the Nazis to its current site, as part of their redesign of Berlin. Standing sixty-seven meters tall, it provides incredible views of both the nearby Tiergarten and all of Berlin.</p>

		<p class="captions">This piece of the Berlin Wall stands in Leipziger Platz, one of the central, modern squares of Berlin. Walking around Berlin in 2016, itâ€™s difficult to imagine what it was like less than thirty years ago, when it was all but impossible to cross between the cityâ€™s eastern and western sides. The entire city today is a testament to the power of unity.</p>

		<p class="captions">In this picture is the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, finished in 2005. Located near Brandenburger Tor, the monument consists of a field of stelae and honors the millions of Jewish victims of the Holocaust. It was inaugurated on the sixtieth anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/LbRGElJ.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">While I was in Berlin, the Orlando nightclub shooting had taken place in the United States. It resulted in the killing of 49 people and the wounding of 53 others, making it the deadliest mass shooting in US history. Located adjacent to Brandenburger Tor is the United States embassy, and here I found this memorial to the Orlando shooting victims.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/2JABk4V.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">This is the Konzerthaus Berlin, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Itâ€™s one of three major architectural structures located in Berlinâ€™s Gendarmenmarkt square, along with the FranzÃ¶sischer Dom and Deutscher Dom. The Gendarmenmarkt was created in the late seventeenth century, heavily damaged during World War II, and restored afterwards to its current state. Today, the Konzerthaus is home to the Konzerthausorchester Berlin or Berlin Symphony Orchestra.</p>

		<p class="captions">The dome of the Reichstag building (shown earlier) is yet another prominent landmark of Berlin. It was designed by Norman Foster and is a recent development, symbolizing the reunification of Germany. From within the dome, one can view both the parliamentary chamber below and the skyline of Berlin outside.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/4nJnbv1.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Checkpoint Charlie is another famous historical site in Berlin. Located at FriedrichstraÃŸe, it was the best known border crossing between East and West Berlin. Around the checkpoint today, there a few galleries about the Berlin Wall, with an interesting one talking about some of the (both failed and successful) attempts to cross the border. Just when I was leaving the checkpoint, there was a huge downpour which was pretty wild...</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/aS5lNGa.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Topographie Des Terrors is a really cool museum which is actually located on the former grounds of the Nazi regimeâ€™s Gestapo and SS headquarters. It has both an outdoor section and a massive indoor section, both of which are extremely informative and which Iâ€™d recommend visiting. Behind the outdoor display, you can find a fragment of the Wall.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/kwm1FMX.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">A pretty rainbow over the river Spree! This view is from the Berliner Fernsehturm, or Berlin TV Tower, the second tallest structure in the European Union. Itâ€™s located right near Alexanderplatz and gives yet another awesome view of the city. One thing to note about Berlin (and all of Germany) in June is that it rains a ton, so you should probably have a hooded sweatshirt or umbrella ready at all times.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/psZxcfK.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">I like visiting arenas so here is a picture of the Mercedes-Benz Arena in the eastern part of Berlin. It is home to Alba Berlin, historically the strongest basketball team in Germany. Right in front of the arena, you can find a Mercedes-Benz car; right across the street is the East Side Gallery.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/KyDP78R.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">This was one of my favorite segments of the East Side Gallery. The gallery is essentially a 1.3 km long segment of the former Berlin Wall that has today become an open-air display of paintings by artists from all around the world. Itâ€™s located right next to the river Spree and itâ€™s a nice walk from one end to the other.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/bUXEwVe.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">A view of a former stretch of the Berlin Wall as part of the GedenkstÃ¤tte Berliner Mauer, or Berlin Wall Memorial. The Berlin Wall was actually more than just a single wall and in a lot of areas, there would be two walls with a no-manâ€™s land in between. As you can see in this picture, thereâ€™s a guard tower located within the no-manâ€™s land which would have prevented attempts to cross the gap. In the background, you can see the Berliner Fernsehturm again.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZyL7ANU.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">This is the Olympiastadion Berlin, which was built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. It played an important role in the propaganda of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and at one point had a maximal capacity of over a hundred thousand. Today, the stadium is home to the local Bundesliga football team, Hertha BSC.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/vkVFvsm.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Finally, this is a look at Karl-Marx-Allee, which was known for being the most famous street in East Germany. Formerly known as Stalinallee, it is massively wide and lined with Stalinist wedding-cake style buildings. Itâ€™s especially interesting, because the style of the street is markedly different from that of the former West German streets. This street is where I ended my trip to Berlin. As stated earlier, I think that Berlinâ€™s history is what makes it most special and itâ€™s crazy how much the city has developed since the fall of the wall. Overall, I enjoyed Germany very much and hope to visit back soon!</p>
