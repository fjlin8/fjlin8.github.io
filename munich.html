		<h1>Munich</h1>
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/p35gLLq.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The beginning of a journey! My European adventure commences with a train ride from Paris to Munich. Munich, or München in German, is a southeastern German city with a history heavily linked to its longtime role as Bavarian capital… so much that in fact, many in München identify more as Bavarians than Germans! Today, München is Germany’s third-largest city and known for its high standards of living.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/6QbEwYH.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The city center of München is a square called Marienplatz, or Mary’s Square. At the center of the square is a statue called Mariensäule, or Mary’s Column, which is seen in this picture. Marienplatz is a major tourist attraction and bustling at all times of the day; its primary feature is the impressive Neues Rathaus (New City Hall) that towers over the square.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/2YbOz3z.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">This is the view of Marienplatz and the Neues Rathaus, as seen from Peterskirche (St. Peter’s Church). Of the front face of the New City Hall (in green), you can see the Rathaus-Glockenspiel, which reenacts two ancient German tales through music and movement several times each day. Neues Rathaus is called as such because it currently hosts the München city government.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/9QFZEVW.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Hofgarten, or court garden, of München is located to the northeast of the city. At the center of the garden stands a pavilion which dates back all the way to 1615. Nearby the Hofgarten, you can find the Bayerische Staatskanzlei (Bavarian State Chancellery), the Münchner Residenz (former royal palace), and the Englischer Garten (English Garden).</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/DPcHLMi.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The English Garden has a manmade river which runs throughout it, called the Eisbach. At this point in the river, you can actually see river surfers trying to ride the waves of the Eisbach as spectators watch on.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/pdim3K1.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Also located in the English Garden is the Schönfeldwiese (Schönfeld meadow), a pleasant place to lie down, enjoy the good weather, and take a nap. Some history on the English Garden… the English Garden is named as such because it was designed by a British physicist (who later became a Bavarian count). It’s pretty big, too, larger than New York’s Central Park.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/k8cvlQi.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Chinesischer Turm (Chinese Tower) is a famous pagoda located within the park. It’s a popular attraction because it’s also home to one of the biggest beer gardens in all of Munich.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/01THn2l.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Taking a walk down Ludwigstraße, or Ludwig Street, I passed by the Siegestor (Victory Gate), the first of many triumphal arches I would encounter in Europe. Both the street and the university on the right of this picture (Ludwig Maximilian University) are named for Ludwig I, former king of Bavaria. The Siegestor, too, was commissioned by Ludwig I.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/0eu0KJO.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The famous Allianz Arena, home to FC Bayern München and known for its unique color-changing exterior. Bayern, which plays in the Bundesliga, is historically Germany’s most successful football club and has won a record twenty-six national titles since its inception. The arena has a capacity of 75,000 and also hosted matches for the 2006 World Cup.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/SJYOx0E.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Olympiapark München was constructed for the 1972 Summer Olympics and is located in the northwest of the city. Today, it is still used for hosting concerts and as a park. Also found within the park is the 291 meter tall Olympic Tower.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Xh2h4lb.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Found adjacent to Olympiapark München are BMW Headquarters, BMW Welt, and the BMW Museum. The Bavarian automaker’s headquarters is designed in the shape of a four-cylinder car engine, making it an architectural spectacle in itself. This picture is taken from within the BMW Welt exhibition facility, where you can find many of BMW’s current products, including cars and motorcycles.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/hUNNJOr.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Schloss Nymphenburg, or Nymphenburg Palace, is a magnificent palace located within the western city limits of München. Built in the seventeenth century, when the area was still countryside, the palace was designed to be a summer residence for Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. Today, it retains much of its beauty and is an incredible remnant from the Baroque period.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/JZE2aen.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Behind the main palace of Schloss Nymphenburg, there’s an enormous and beautiful park open to the public. Many of the gardens’ walkways are lined with statues of gods and the park is filled with many different types of birds. The park also has a ton of benches, making it a really nice place to just sit down and enjoy the peace.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/rFObZxV.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">A view of Schloss Nymphenburg from the back. Canals penetrate out from both the front and back of the palace, and lakes can also be found on both sides of the western canal. Walking around the park, it’s pretty crazy to imagine what it must’ve been like to live as Bavarian royalty centuries ago.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/FdCHCyn.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Because the park was designed as a summer residence, while walking around, you will find a royal pavilion, bathing house, and hunting lodge. In this picture, you can see Amalienburg, a hunting lodge dedicated to Maria Amalia, the former Electress of Bavaria.</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/lmsnWYS.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Back in the old city of München, this is Sendlinger Tor, or Sendling Gate. Sendlinger Tor used to be the southern gate to the city and remains today as a monument to the city’s historic past. Passing beneath the gate basically marked the end to my enjoyable time in Munich, as well. If you want to visit a quieter historic city, then I would recommend visiting!</p> 
		<p><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/IMfs37U.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">On the day that I left, I also decided to pay a visit to KZ-Gedenkstätte Dachau, a memorial for the Dachau Concentration Camp. Dachau was one of the first Nazi concentration camps in Germany, originally serving as a political prisoner camp begfore turning into the model for many other Nazi concentration camps. The concrete foundations seen in this picture show the original barrack locations while a guard tower can be seen in the background.</p>
