		<h1>Travels</h1>
		<p>Traveling is one of my passions and I love exploring the world. There is something special about immersing oneself in different cultures that canâ€™t be experienced from home. On this page, you can find links to albums of photographs that I took during my travels (excuse the photo quality! I took them on my phone). Beneath some of the pictures, I have also written short commentaries. Hope you enjoy!</p>
