				<p>Hello! My name is Frank and I am originally from New York.</p>
				<p>Currently, I’m in my second year of undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, where I am pursuing a double major in Applied Maths and Computer Science. This semester, I am taking courses in machine structures [CS 61C], algorithms [CS 170], linear algebra/circuits [EE 16A], and French [French 1]. I am highly passionate about learning and strongly believe in the importance of well-roundedness. I also find it important to keep an open mind in order to understand the world through varied perspectives; this means that I’m interested in hearing the views of people like you!</p>
				<p>In my free time, I enjoy running and playing basketball. I am also an avid fan of both college and pro basketball, but I try to follow sports that I’m less familiar with like tennis, football (both varieties), and rugby! Another of my passions is traveling and exploring the world. My most recent adventures took me through various cities across Central Europe, which you can see through pictures on my travel page. Finally, I like to listen to lots of different types of music, and I am always open to recommendations.</p>
				<p>If you'd like to reach out to me, please shoot me an e-mail at fjlin97(at)gmail(dot)com!<br>I look forward to hearing from you and what you have to say. ☺</p>
