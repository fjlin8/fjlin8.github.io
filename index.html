				<p>Hello! My name is Frank and I’m from New York.</p>
				<p>I’m currently in my third year of undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley, where I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. This semester, I am taking courses in computer security [CS 161], probability theory [EECS 126], abstract algebra [Math 113], and linguistics [Ling 100]. I’m a passionate learner who strongly values the importance of keeping an open mind. Only through viewing the world from varied perspectives can we come closer to understanding the world around us.</p>
				<p>In my free time, I enjoy running and shooting hoops. I’m an avid fan of both college and pro basketball, but I also like to follow tennis, college football, and T&F. Apart from sports, I love traveling and exploring places I’ve never been. My most recent adventures took me through France, Italy, and Switzerland during the summer of 2017. For more, check out my travel page, where you’ll also find some photos from my trips.</p>
				<p>If you'd like to reach out to me, please shoot me an e-mail at <span class="rev">moc.liamg@79niljf</span> <br>I look forward to hearing from you and what you have to say. ☺</p>
