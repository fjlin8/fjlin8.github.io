				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<div class="chunk">
					<p>Hello! My name is Frank and Iâ€™m from New York.</p>
					<p><strong>On Studies ðŸ“–: </strong>Iâ€™m currently in my third year of undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. This semester, I am taking courses in computer security [CS 161], probability theory [EECS 126], abstract algebra [Math 113], and linguistics [Ling 100]. Iâ€™m a passionate learner who strongly values the importance of keeping an open mind. Only through viewing the world from varied perspectives can we come closer to understanding the world around us.<br><br>Check out my <a href="/studies">studies page</a> for some of my relevant coursework.</p>
					<p><strong>On Talks ðŸ—£: </strong>In particular, I really enjoy attending talks. When it comes to learning, itâ€™s always in your best interest to interact with people who know more, who have more experience, and who think differently. Some talks present opportunities to explore subject areas that Iâ€™d otherwise never encounter on my own. Others help bolster my specialized knowledge by means of hearing from experts in the field. No matter who you are, it behooves you to go out there and continue learning!<br><br>Check out some <a href="/talks">selected talks</a> that Iâ€™ve attended lately.</p>
					<p><strong>On Leisure âœˆ: </strong>In my free time, I enjoy distance running and shooting hoops. Iâ€™m an avid fan of both college and pro basketball, but I also like to follow tennis, college football, and T&F. Apart from sports, I love traveling and exploring places Iâ€™ve never been. My most recent adventures took me through <span style="color:blue;">France</span>, <span style="color:green;">Italy</span>, and <span style="color:red;">Switzerland</span> during the summer of 2017.<br><br>Check out my <a href="/travel">travel page</a>, where youâ€™ll find my travel log and photos.</p>
					<p>If you'd like to reach out to me or have a chat, please shoot me an e-mail at <span class="rev">moc.liamg@79niljf</span>. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
