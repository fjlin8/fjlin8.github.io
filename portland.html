		<h1>Portland ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</h1>

		<p class="captions">During the descent of our 76-minute flight from San Francisco Intâ€™l (SFO) to Portland Intâ€™l (PDX), we were able to spot Oregonâ€™s highest mountain. Mt. Hood is located less than two hours from the city of Portland and is also a potentially active volcano, considered the most likely of Oregonâ€™s volcanoes to erupt.</p>

		<p class="captions">After arriving in Portland, we took the TriMet MAX Red Line to the downtown waterfront. The Steel Bridge is a vertical-lift bridge that crosses the cityâ€™s main Willamette River, accommodating rail, automobile, bike, and pedestrian traffic. During our trip, we crossed the Steel Bridge both ways, over both its lower and upper decks.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/1qUQr9w.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Moda Center (formerly known as the Rose Garden) is located on the eastern bank of the Willamette, which divides Portlandâ€™s west and east sides. The arena is located in an area called the Rose Quarter and is home to the Portland Trail Blazers, the cityâ€™s NBA team. Unfortunately, the timing didnâ€™t work out for us to attend a game!</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/deFCk8j.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Back on the west side of the Willamette, we visited the Portland Saturday Market, "the largest continually operating outdoor arts and crafts market in the nation." Located in downtown Old Town and spanning several street blocks, the market was bustling with live music, food carts, and various arts and crafts shops during our time there.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/oZeQ4Xb.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">As we returned to Tom McCann Waterfront Park (which borders the Willamette waterfront), we sat on the steps of the Bill Naito Legacy Fountain. Portland truly is a city filled with fountains. Exploring the city, one can probably find at least one water fountain on every single street block.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/lQoICX2.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">This was a viewing party in downtown Pioneer Courthouse Square for the IAAF World Indoor Championships. During our trip, the city was hosting the worldâ€™s premier track and field athletes at the nearby Oregon Convention Center. As a result, we saw many competing athletes throughout the city during our stay.</p>

		<p class="captions">A view of Portlandâ€™s Marquam Bridge, viewed from Waterfront Park near sunset time. Believe it or not, Marquam Bridge is just one of a whopping twelve bridges that span the Willamette River in Portland. The majority of these are walkable (and bikeable), providing great views of both downtown and the river.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Wmpn7ap.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The city of Portland may purport to have a population of over six hundred thousand, but you wouldnâ€™t know it from walking around it. For most of our trip, we were left wondering where all the people went; navigating the city, we found street after street to be devoid of human life and moving cars.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/d7gsev1.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Portlandâ€™s public transportation system, TriMet, is absolutely phenomenal. A $5 TriMet day pass gets you unlimited access to the cityâ€™s comprehensive rail (MAX) and bus lines, which allowed us to go everywhere we wanted. TriMet is also astonishingly modern. For example, each station has an ID that can be searched up to show the arrival time of the next train or bus.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/w2nNQTt.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">TriMetâ€™s MAX lines are also unique in that the trains run above-ground in the city, alongside automobiles. This makes it extremely easy to get onto a station and also provides fantastic views of the city. On the right of this photo, you can also spot the Union Pacific railroad tracks, which connect the west coast all the way to Chicago.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/Qs64CxO.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Oaks Amusement Park, located southeast of downtown Portland across the Willamette River, is a blast from the past. Despite having opened over a century ago, it continues to operate rides for the Pacific Northwest today. This here is a view of the amusement park as seen from the top of its Ferris wheel.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/hjlIlYn.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Next, we went to Washington Park in western Portland, home to the Hoyt Arboretum. We hiked the Wildwood Trail, which loops through the forest and is filled with awe-inspiring views of trees like these. Not often will you find an entire forest located within a cityâ€™s limits. Portland truly is special.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/lhXJIvM.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Washington Park is also home to the Oregon Vietnam Veterans Memorial, an architectural spectacle. The memorial consists of circular loops surrounding the central Garden of Solace and, especially in the rain, brings a calming sensation to all those in it.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/FOx0SuQ.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">On Sunday night, we viewed a performance of Brahmsâ€™ Variations on a Theme by Joseph Haydn, Haydnâ€™s Symphony No. 90, and Straussâ€™ Don Quixote, performed by the Oregon Symphony. It is unlikely that the average age of the attendees was under fifty.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/LlnyC3N.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The performance took place downtown at Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, colloquially referred to as the "Schnitz". The Schnitz is Portlandâ€™s last remnant of old Broadway, which used to be lined with theaters. Should you attend a performance here, be sure to ask for the student discount... tickets were just $10.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/phJGWtj.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">On Monday morning, we left the city of Portland for a tour of Oregonâ€™s renowned waterfalls. But first, we made a stop at the Vista House, found 733 feet above the Columbia River. From there we had this amazing view of the Columbia River Gorge, which forms the border between the states of Washington and Oregon.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/RJL0nuJ.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Although Multnomah Falls may be Oregonâ€™s most famous falls, my favorite was Latourell Falls (249 feet). There's something mesmerizing about watching water plummet hundreds of feet right in front of your very eyes. Can you feel the water spraying on your face?</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/BP0lYo7.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Our Portland trip ended at Union Station in downtown, where we boarded our northbound Amtrak train to Seattle. All in all, Portland is an amazing city that boasts an amazing selection of both natural and cultural attractions. The city itself gives off a unique small-city vibe that differentiates it from larger metropolises like New York and San Francisco. Finally, its exceptional public transportation system, TriMet, makes it an easily navigable tourist destination, even if you donâ€™t have a car. Itâ€™s no wonder Portland consistently ranks as one of the most livable cities in America - if you're visiting the west coast, Portland is a must visit!</p>
