		<h1>Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·</h1>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/xacHFG1.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The last city of my trip, Paris. Straddled by the river Seine, Paris is the capital and largest city of France, as well as one of the most popular tourist cities in the world.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/jWibPph.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The HÃ´tel National des Invalides or National Residence of the Invalids is a building complex that includes Franceâ€™s military museum, several art museums, and the DÃ´me des Invalides pictured here. This church was commissioned by King Louis XIV in the seventeenth century and today houses the tomb of Napoleon.</p>

		<p class="captions">During my entire time in Paris (and Europe), France was hosting UEFA Euro 2016, the quadrennial European menâ€™s football tournament. As a result, there were many fan zones set up around the city, including the Eiffel Tower Fan Zone, right below the Tour Eiffel. Because of the tourney, I ended up seeing more Icelanders, Hungarians, and Austrians than Iâ€™d ever seen in my life during my stay in Paris.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/NX25b2s.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Obviously, a trip to Paris is not complete without seeing the Tour Eiffel, although it did take a long time to walk there. Paris is a huge city, and the tower is out pretty far west. As expected, there were a ton of tourists there, but it was nice to just chill in the grass in front of the tower for a bit to take in the scene.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/RAlAsb5.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Another major monument in Paris is the Arc de Triomphe (de l'Ã‰toile), which felt like the millionth triumphal arch I saw in Europe. Itâ€™s located right at the end of the famous Avenue des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es and it honors those who participated in the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars. Just looking at it, it really is an impressive and commanding structure. More on this later.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/hG8rr17.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">At night, Paris turns into an even prettier city than it is by day. Although, like the rest of Europe, night comes a lot later than it does in the states, meaning itâ€™s still bright at 22:00. Anyways, this is a nice picture of the Seine at night with La Grande Roue de Paris in the background.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/4m4Of7z.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Pont/Passerelle de Arts is one of the many bridges that crosses the Seine; this one is unique in that it used to be the bridge with the famous love locks on it, but since that made the bridge too heavy, they were removed. Now, it has temporary art exhibitions on it, like the one seen in this picture.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/mk0wLLk.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The famous Pyramide du Louvre or Louvre Pyramid which sits in the courtyard of the Louvre Palace. It was commissioned by FranÃ§ois Mitterrand in 1984 and is the entrance to the Louvre Museum, the worldâ€™s largest and second most-visited museum.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/r8ASfHy.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The most famous painting in the Louvre, and probably the entire world, is the Mona Lisa. If you donâ€™t know what it is, it was a portrait painted by Leonardo da Vinci and now itâ€™s a place where big crowds like to converge and take selfies so that they can say they saw the Mona Lisa (like me).</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/3Popl5w.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Since there are no more love locks on the Pont de Arts, I suppose people decided they needed to find another bridge, so they chose the Passerelle LÃ©opold-SÃ©dar-Senghor, another bridge that crosses the Seine.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/4dc43n8.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">In Paris, you are actually able to walk by the Seine, although not always since recently the city has been ravaged by floods. Because the tide is so high, sometimes youâ€™ll see stairways lead right down into the water, which is kind of funny. I think I saw some people try to go fishing in the Seine as well.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/eSjwGsf.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Basilique du SacrÃ©-CÅ“ur de Montmartre or Basilica to the Sacred Heart of Paris is the famous Roman Catholic church in the north of the city. Itâ€™s located at the top of the Montmartre hill and from the top, you can get a grand view of the city. The basilica is also a monument for Franceâ€™s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and it is located right next to the historically artsy Montmartre district.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/TlYCfDC.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Place de la Bastille is the square where the famous storming of the Bastille took place during the French Revolution. Today, it is the location of the Colonne de Juillet or July Column, which is a memorial to the July Revolution. Also located at the square are the OpÃ©ra Bastille and a canal.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/vaoSnyW.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Notre-Dame Cathedral, located on the island of ÃŽle de la CitÃ©, is one of my favorite landmarks. The gigantic structure, seen here at sunset, was originally constructed starting in the twelfth century, which is insane given how huge the cathedral is. Personally, I think Notre-Dame is one of the most incredible feats of architecture in the entire world.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/UAsONvF.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Palais du Luxembourg or Luxembourg Paris is a palace located in the Jardin du Luxembourg. It was commissioned by Marie de MÃ©dici and constructed in the seventeenth century. In front of the palace, thereâ€™s a large pool of water where children can sail model boats and poke at them with sticks. The Jardin du Luxembourg or Luxembourg Garden is a very pretty urban garden that is great place to relax on a sunny day.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/d48NwKc.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">Apart from the Louvre, the next great museum in Paris is the MusÃ©e d'Orsay, also located on the banks of the Seine. The museum itself is unique in that it used to be a train station, the Gare d'Orsay, and was only recently converted in 1986. It mostly houses art from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, including some nice impressionist and post-impressionist paintings by Monet and Gauguin.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/X0KPIUE.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">This is the Place de la Concorde, the largest public square in Paris, with the Grande Roue de Paris in the background. Itâ€™s located all the way at the east end of the Avenue des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es and has the pictured obelisk at its center. Historically, itâ€™s significant in that this is where King Louis XVI was guillotined in 1793.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/gnf1IHe.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">I think the nicest view of the city comes from the Arc de Triomphe, so I went back there on my last night to watch the sunset. In this picture, you can see the sun setting over La Defense, the business district of Paris, in the west. From the top of the Arc, you can really see most of the city, even if youâ€™re not as high as you would be on the Tour Eiffel or Tour Montparnasse.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/ViJ1ahw.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Arc de Triomphe is located pretty close to the Tour Eiffel, so thatâ€™s what most people are looking at. From the Arc, you can also get nice views of SacrÃ©-CÅ“ur and Notre-Dame, and from the first time I was there, you can even see the rain forming in the distance when itâ€™s cloudy (which it always is in Europe).</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/sxe2tjE.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Avenue des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es is the famous shopping boulevard in Paris and since it ends at the Arc, you get an awesome view of it. When a Portuguese football hooligan stormed into the middle of the Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es and started waving a massive Portuguese flag (while majorly disrupting traffic), I got a good view of that too.</p>
		<p class="image"><img class="resize" src="https://i.imgur.com/yNubF3t.jpg"></p>
		<p class="captions">The Arc de Triomphe is where I ended my Paris trip, and hence my entire European trip. All in all, it was a tremendous few weeks and a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Paris is a fantastic city with far more to do than anyone can do in four days, and it has its popular reputation for a reason. I hope you enjoyed these picture albums, and I would love to post more soon!</p>
